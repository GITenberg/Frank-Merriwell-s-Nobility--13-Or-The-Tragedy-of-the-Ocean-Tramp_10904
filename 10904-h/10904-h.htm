  <h2>CHAPTER I.</h2>

  <h3>OFF FOR EUROPE.</h3>

  <p>"Off&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"At last!"</p>

  <p>"Hurrah!"</p>

  <p>The tramp steamer "Eagle" swung out from the pier and was
  fairly started en her journey from New York to Liverpool.</p>

  <p>On the deck of the steamer stood a group of five persons,
  three of whom had given utterance to the exclamations recorded
  above.</p>

  <p>On the pier swarmed a group of Yale students, waving hands,
  hats, handkerchiefs, bidding farewell to their five friends and
  acquaintances on the steamer. Over the water came the familiar
  Yale cheer. From the steamer it was answered.</p>

  <p>In the midst of the group on deck was Frank Merriwell. Those
  around him were Bruce Browning, Jack Diamond, Harry Rattleton and
  Tutor Wellington Maybe.</p>

  <p>It was Frank's scheme to spend the summer months abroad, while
  studying in the attempt to catch up with his class and pass
  examinations on re-entering college in the fall. And he had
  brought along his three friends, Browning, Diamond and Rattleton.
  They were on their way to England.</p>

  <p>Frank was happy. Fortune had dealt him a heavy blow when he
  was compelled by poverty to leave dear old Yale, but he had faced
  the world bravely, and he had struggled like a man. Hard work,
  long hours and poor pay had not daunted him.</p>

  <p>At the very start he had shown that he possessed something
  more than ordinary ability, and while working on the railroad he
  had forced his way upward step by step till it seemed that he was
  in a fair way to reach the top of the ladder.</p>

  <p>Then came disaster again. He had lost his position on the
  railroad, and once more he was forced to face the world and begin
  over.</p>

  <p>Some lads would have been discouraged. Frank Merriwell was
  not. He set his teeth firmly and struck out once more. He kept
  his mouth shut and his eyes open. The first honorable thing that
  came to his hand to do he did. Thus it happened that he found
  himself on the stage.</p>

  <p>Frank's success as an actor had been phenomenal. Of course, to
  begin with, he had natural ability, but that was not the only
  thing that won success for him. He had courage, push,
  determination, stick-to-it-iveness. When he started to do a thing
  he kept at it till he did it.</p>

  <p>Frank united observation and study. He learned everything he
  could about the stage and about acting by talking with the
  members of the company and by watching to see how things were
  done.</p>

  <p>He had a good head and plenty of sense. He knew better than to
  copy after the ordinary actors in the road company to which he
  belonged. He had seen good acting enough to be able to
  distinguish between the good and bad. Thus it came about that the
  bad models about him did not exert a pernicious influence upon
  him.</p>

  <p>Frank believed there were books that would aid him. He found
  them. He found one on "Acting and Actors," and from it he learned
  that no actor ever becomes really and truly great that does not
  have a clear and distinct enunciation and a correct
  pronunciation. That is the beginning. Then comes the study of the
  meaning of the words to be spoken and the effect produced by the
  manner in which they are spoken.</p>

  <p>He studied all this, and he went further. He read up on
  "Traditions of the Stage," and he came to know all about its
  limitations and its opportunities.</p>

  <p>From this it was a natural step to the study of the
  construction of plays. He found books of criticism on plays and
  playwriting, and he mastered them. He found books that told how
  to construct plays, and he mastered them.</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell was a person with a vivid imagination and
  great mechanical and constructive ability. Had this not been so,
  he might have studied forever and still never been able to write
  a successful play. In him there was something study could not
  give, but study and effort brought it out. He wrote a play.</p>

  <p>"John Smith of Montana" was a success. Frank played the
  leading part, and he made a hit.</p>

  <p>Then fate rose up and again dealt him a body blow. A scene in
  the play was almost exactly like a scene in another play, written
  previously. The author and owner of the other play called on the
  law to "protect" him. An injunction was served on Merry to
  restrain him from playing "John Smith." He stood face to face
  with a lawsuit.</p>

  <p>Frank investigated, and his investigation convinced him that
  it was almost certain he would be defeated if the case was
  carried into the courts.</p>

  <p>He withdrew "John Smith."</p>

  <p>Frank had confidence in himself. He had written a play that
  was successful, and he believed he could write another. Already
  he had one skeletonized. The frame work was constructed, the plot
  was elaborated, the characters were ready for his use.</p>

  <p>He wrote a play of something with which he was thoroughly
  familiar&mdash;-college life. The author or play-maker of ability
  who writes of that with which he is familiar stands a good chance
  of making a success. Young and inexperienced writers love to
  write of those things with which they are unfamiliar, and they
  wonder why it is that they fail.</p>

  <p>They go too far away from home for their subject.</p>

  <p>At first Frank's play was not a success. The moment he
  discovered this he set himself down to find out why it was not a
  success. He did not look at it as the author, but as a critical
  manager to whom it had been offered might have done.</p>

  <p>He found the weak spots. One was its name. People in general
  did not understand the title, "For Old Eli." There was nothing
  "catchy" or drawing about it.</p>

  <p>He gave it another name. He called it, "True Blue: A Drama of
  College Life."</p>

  <p>The name proved effective.</p>

  <p>He rewrote much of the play. He strengthened the climax of the
  third act, and introduced a mechanical effect that was very
  ingenious. And when the piece next went on the road it met with
  wonderful success everywhere.</p>

  <p>Thus Frank snatched success from defeat.</p>

  <p>It is a strange thing that when a person fights against fate
  and conquers, when fortune begins to smile, when the tide fairly
  turns his way, then everything seems to come to him. The things
  which seemed so far away and so impossible of attainment suddenly
  appear within easy reach or come tumbling into his lap of their
  own accord.</p>

  <p>It was much this way with Frank. He had dreamed of going back
  to college some time, but that time had seemed far, far away.
  Success brought it nearer.</p>

  <p>But then it came tumbling into his lap. No one had been found
  to claim the fortune he discovered in the Utah Desert.
  Investigation had shown that there were no living relatives of
  the man who had guarded the treasure till his death. That
  treasure had been turned over to Frank.</p>

  <p>Frank had brought his play to New Haven, and his old college
  friends had given him a rousing welcome. And now he had made
  plans to return to college in the fall, while his play was to be
  carried on the road by a well-known and experienced theatrical
  manager.</p>

  <p>The friends who had been with Frank when he discovered the
  treasure, with the exception of Toots, the colored boy, had
  refused to accept shares of the fortune. Then Merry had insisted
  on taking them abroad with him, and here they were on the steamer
  "Eagle," bound for Liverpool.</p>

  <p>Toots, dressed like a "swell," was on the pier. He shouted
  with the others, waving his silk hat.</p>

  <p>The crowd was cheering now:</p>
  <pre>
     "Beka Co ax Co ax Co ax!
     Breka Co ax Co ax Co ax!
       O&mdash;&mdash;up! O&mdash;&mdash;up!

  <h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

  <h3>SURPRISING THE FRENCHMAN.</h3>

  <p>"Bah! Ze American boy, he make me&mdash;what you call
  eet?&mdash;vera tired!"</p>

  <p>Frank turned quickly and saw the speaker standing near the
  rail not far away. He was a man between thirty-five and forty
  years of age, dressed in a traveling suit, and having a pointed
  black beard. He was smoking.</p>

  <p>An instant feeling of aversion swept over Merry. He saw the
  person was a supercilious Frenchman, critical, sneering,
  insolent, a man intolerant with everything not of France and the
  French.</p>

  <p>This man was speaking to another person, who seemed to be a
  servant or valet, and who was very polite and fawning in all his
  retorts.</p>

  <p>"Ah! look at ze collectshung on ze pier," continued the
  sneering speaker. "Someone say zey belong to ze great American
  college. Zey act like zey belong to ze&mdash;ze&mdash;what you
  call eet?&mdash;ze menageray. Zey yell, shout, jump&mdash;act
  like ze lunatic."</p>

  <p>"It is possible, monsieur," said Frank, with a grim smile,
  "that they are copying their manners after Frenchmen at a Dreyfus
  demonstration."</p>

  <p>The foreigner turned haughtily and stared at Frank. Then he
  shrugged his shoulders, turned away and observed to his
  companion:</p>

  <p>"Jes' like all ze Americans&mdash;ah!&mdash;what eez ze
  word?&mdash;fresh."</p>

  <p>The other man bowed and rubbed his hands together.</p>

  <p>"Haw!" grunted Browning, lazily. "How do you like that,
  Frank?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I don't mind it," murmured Merry. "I consider the source
  from which it came, and regard it as of no consequence."</p>

  <p>Diamond was glaring at the Frenchman, for it made his hot
  Southern blood boil to hear a foreigner criticize anything
  American. Like all youthful Americans, his great admiration and
  love for his own country made him intolerant of criticism.</p>

  <p>Frank had a cooler head, and he was not so easily ruffled.</p>

  <p>Rattleton was unable to express his feelings.</p>

  <p>Tutor Maybe looked somewhat perturbed, for he was an
  exceedingly mild and peaceable man, and the slightest suggestion
  of trouble was enough to agitate him.</p>

  <p>But the Frenchman did not deign to look toward Frank again,
  and it seemed that all danger of trouble was past.</p>

  <p>The "Eagle" sailed slowly down the harbor, signaling now and
  then to other boats.</p>

  <p>Frank, Jack, Bruce and Harry formed a fine quartette, and they
  sang:</p>
  <pre>
     "Soon we'll be in London town;
       Sing, my lads, yo! heave, my lads, ho!
     And see the queen, with her golden crown;
       Heave, my lads, yo-ho!"
</pre>

  <p>The Frenchman made an impatient gesture, and showed annoyance,
  which caused Frank to laugh.</p>

  <p>Behind them Brooklyn Bridge spanned the river, looking slender
  and graceful, like a thing hung in the air by delicate
  threads.</p>

  <p>Close at hand were Governor's Island and the Statue of
  Liberty. The Frenchman was pointing it out.</p>

  <p>"Ze greatest work of art in all America,"' he declared,
  enthusiastically; "an' France give zat to America. Ze Americans
  nevare think to put eet zere themselves. France do more for
  America zan any ozare nation, but ze Americans forget. Zey forget
  Lafayette. Zey forget France make it possibul for zem to
  conquaire Engalande an' get ze freedom zey ware aftaire. An' now
  zey&mdash;zey&mdash;what you call eet?&mdash;toady to Engalande.
  Zey pretende to love ze Engaleesh. Bah! Uncale Sam an' John Bull
  both need to have some of ze conaceit taken out away from
  zem."</p>

  <p>"It would take more than France, Spain, Italy and all the rest
  of the dago nations to do the job!" spluttered Harry Rattleton,
  who could not keep still longer.</p>

  <p>"Maurel," said the Frenchman, speaking to his companion,
  "t'row ze insolent dog ovareboard!"</p>

  <p>"Oui, monsieur!"</p>

  <p>Quick as thought the man sprang toward Harry, as if determined
  to execute the command of his master.</p>

  <p>He did not put his hands on Rattleton, for Frank was equally
  swift in his movements, and blocked the fellows' way, coolly
  saying:</p>

  <p>"I wouldn't try it if I were you."</p>

  <p>"Out of ze way!" snarled the man, who was an athlete in build.
  "If you don't, I put you ovare, too!"</p>

  <p>"I don't think you will."</p>

  <p>"Put him ovare, Maurel," ordered the Frenchman, with deadly
  coolness.</p>

  <p>The athletic servant clutched Frank, but, with a twist and a
  turn, Merry broke the hold instantly, kicked the fellow's feet
  from beneath him, and dropped him heavily to the deck.</p>

  <p>Bruce Browning stooped and picked the man up as if he were an
  infant. Every year seemed to add something to the big collegian's
  wonderful strength, and now the astounded Frenchman found himself
  unable to wiggle.</p>

  <p>Browning held the man over the rail turning to Frank to
  ask:</p>

  <p>"Shall I give him a bath, Merriwell?"</p>

  <p>"I think you hadn't better," laughed Frank. "Perhaps he can't
  swim, and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"He can swim or sink," drawled Bruce. "It won't make any
  difference if he sinks. Only another insolent Frenchman out of
  the way."</p>

  <p>The master was astounded. Up to that moment he had regarded
  the young Americans as scarcely more than boys and he had fancied
  his athletic servant could easily frighten them. Instead of that,
  something quite unexpected by him had happened.</p>

  <p>The astounded servant showed signs of terror, but in vain he
  struggled. He was helpless in the clutch of the giant
  collegian.</p>

  <p>The master seemed about to interfere, but Frank Merriwell
  confronted him in a manner that spoke as plainly as words.</p>

  <p>"Out of ze way!" snarled the man.</p>

  <p>"Speaking to me?" inquired Merry, lifting his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"Oui! oui!"</p>

  <p>"I am sorry, but I can't accommodate you till my friend gets
  through with your servant, who was extremely fresh, like most
  Frenchmen."</p>

  <p>"Zis to me!"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Sare, I am M. Rouen Montfort, an' I&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference to me if you are the high mogul of
  France. You are on the deck of an English vessel, and you are
  dealing with Americans."</p>

  <p>The Frenchman flung his cigar aside and seemed to feel for a
  weapon.</p>

  <p>Frank stood there quietly, his eyes watching every
  movement.</p>

  <p>"If you have what you are seeking about your person," he said,
  with perfect calmness, "I advise you not to draw it. If you do,
  as sure as you are sailing down New York harbor, I'll fling you
  over the rail, weapon and all!"</p>

  <p>That was business, and it was not boasting. Frank actually
  meant to throw the man into the water if he drew a weapon.</p>

  <p>M. Rouen Montfort paused and stared at Frank Merriwell,
  beginning to understand that he was not dealing with an ordinary
  youth.</p>

  <p>"Fool!" he panted. "You geeve me ze eensult I will haf your
  life!"</p>

  <p>"You have already insulted me, my friends and everything
  American. It's your turn to take a little of the medicine."</p>

  <p>"Eef we were een France&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Which we are not. We are still in America, the land of the
  free. But I don't care to have a quarrel with you. Bruce put the
  fellow down. If he minds his business in the future, don't throw
  him overboard."</p>

  <p>"All right," grunted the big fellow; "but I was just going to
  drop him in the wet."</p>

  <p>He put the man down, and the fellow seemed undecided what to
  do.</p>

  <p>Harry Rattleton laughed.</p>

  <p>"Now wake a talk&mdash;no, I mean take a walk," he cried. "It
  will be a good thing for your health."</p>

  <p>"Come, Maurel," said the master, with an attempt at dignity;
  "come away from ze fellows!"</p>

  <p>Maurel was glad enough to do so. He had thought to frighten
  the youths without the least trouble, but had been handled with
  such ease that even after it was all over he wondered how it
  could have happened.</p>

  <p>M. Montfort walked away with great dignity, and Maurel
  followed, talking savagely and swiftly in French.</p>

  <p>"Well, it wasn't very hard to settle them," grinned
  Browning.</p>

  <p>"But we have not settled them," declared Frank. "There will be
  further trouble with M. Rouen Montfort and his man Maurel."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER III.</h2>

  <h3>A FRESH YOUNG MAN.</h3>

  <p>Frank and his three friends bad a stateroom together. The
  tutor was given a room with other parties.</p>

  <p>The weather for the first two days was fine, and the young
  collegians enjoyed every minute, not one of them having a touch
  of sea-sickness till the third day.</p>

  <p>Then Rattleton was seized, and he lay in his bunk, groaning
  and dismal, even though he tried to be cheerful at times.</p>

  <p>Browning enjoyed everything, even Rattleton's misery, for he
  could be lazy to his heart's content.</p>

  <p>They had enlivened the times by singing songs, those of a
  nautical flavor, such as "Larboard Watch" and "A Life on the
  Ocean Wave," having the preference.</p>

  <p>Now it happened that the Frenchman occupied a room adjoining,
  and he was very much annoyed by their singing. He pounded on the
  partition, and expressed his feelings in very lurid language, but
  that amused them, and they sang the louder.</p>

  <p>"M. Montfort seems to get very agitated," said Frank,
  laughing.</p>

  <p>"But I hardly think there is any danger that he will do more
  than hammer on the partition," grunted Bruce. "He's kept away
  from us since he found he could not frighten anybody."</p>

  <p>"He's a bluffer," was Diamond's opinion.</p>

  <p>"He's a great fellow to play cards," said Merry. "But he seems
  to ply for something more than amusement."</p>

  <p>"How's that?" asked Jack, interested.</p>

  <p>"I've noticed that he never cares for whist or any game where
  there are no stakes. He gets into a game only when there's
  something to be won."</p>

  <p>"Well, it seems to me that he's struck a poor crowd on this
  boat if he's looking for suckers. He should have shipped on an
  ocean liner. What does he play?"</p>

  <p>"He seems to have taken a great fancy to draw poker. 'Pocaire'
  is what he calls it. He pretended at first that he didn't know
  much of anything about the game, but, if I am not mistaken, he's
  an old stager at it. I watched the party playing in the
  smoking-room last night."</p>

  <p>"Who played?" asked Bruce.</p>

  <p>"The Frenchman, a rather sporty young fellow named Bloodgood,
  a small, bespectacled man, well fitted with the name of Slush,
  and an Englishman by the name of Hazleton."</p>

  <p>"That's the crowd that played in the Frenchman's stateroom
  to-day," groaned Rattleton from his berth.</p>

  <p>"Played in the stateroom?" exclaimed Frank. "I wonder why they
  didn't play in the smoking-room?"</p>

  <p>"Don't know," said Harry; "but I fancy there was a rather big
  game on, and you know the Frenchman has the biggest stateroom on
  the boat, so there was plenty of room for them. They could play
  there without interruption."</p>

  <p>"There seems to be something mysterious about that Frenchman,"
  said Frank.</p>

  <p>"I think there's something mysterious about several passengers
  on this boat," grunted Browning. "I haven't seen much of this
  young fellow Bloodgood, but he strikes me as a mystery."</p>

  <p>"Why?"</p>

  <p>"Well he seems to have money to burn, and I don't understand
  why such a fellow did not take passage on a regular liner."</p>

  <p>"As far as that goes," smiled Merry, "I presume some people
  might think it rather singular that we did not cross the pond in
  a regular liner; but then they might suppose it was a case of
  economy with us."</p>

  <p>While they were talking there came a rap on their door which
  Frank threw open.</p>

  <p>Just outside stood a young man with a flushed face and
  distressed appearance. He was dressed in a plaid suit, and wore a
  red four-in-hand necktie, in which blazed a huge diamond. There
  were two large solitaire rings on his left hand, and he wore a
  heavy gold chain strung across his vest.</p>

  <p>"Beg your pardon, dear boys," he drawled. "Hope I'm not
  intruding."</p>

  <p>Then he walked in and closed the door.</p>

  <p>"My name's Bloodgood," he said&mdash;"Raymond Bloodgood. I've
  seen you fellows together, and you seem like a jolly lot. Heard
  you singing, you know. Great voices&mdash;good singing."</p>

  <p>Then he stopped speaking, and they stared at him, wondering
  what he was driving at. For a moment there was an awkward pause,
  and then Bloodgood went on:</p>

  <p>"I was up pretty late last night, you know. Had a little game
  in the smoking-room. Plenty of booze, and all that, and I'm
  awfully rocky to-day. Got a splitting headache. Didn't know but
  some of you had a bromo seltzer, or something of the sort. You
  look like a crowd that finds such things handy occasionally."</p>

  <p>At this Frank laughed quietly, but Diamond looked angry and
  indignant.</p>

  <p>"What do you take us for?" exclaimed the Virginian, warmly.
  "Do you think we are a lot of boozers?"</p>

  <p>Bloodgood turned on Jack, lifting his eyebrows.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow&mdash;" he began.</p>

  <p>But Frank put in:</p>

  <p>"We have no use for bromo seltzer, as none of us are
  drinkers."</p>

  <p>"Oh, of course not," said the intruder, with something like a
  sneer. "None of us are drinkers, but then we're all liable to get
  a little too much sometimes, especially when we sit up late and
  play poker."</p>

  <p>Frank saw that Diamond had taken an instant dislike to the
  youth with the diamonds and the red necktie, and he felt like
  averting a storm, even though he did not fancy the manner of the
  intruder.</p>

  <p>"We do not sit up late and play poker," he said.</p>

  <p>"Eh? Oh, come off! You're a jolly lot of fellows, and you must
  have a fling sometimes."</p>

  <p>"We can be jolly without drinking or gambling."</p>

  <p>"Why, I'm hanged if you don't talk as if you considered it a
  crime to take a drink or have a little social game!"</p>

  <p>Frank felt his blood warm up a bit, but he held himself in
  hand, as he quietly retorted:</p>

  <p>"Intemperance is a crime. I presume there are men who take a
  drink, as you call it, without being intemperate; but I prefer to
  let the stuff alone entirely, and then there is no danger of
  going over the limit."</p>

  <p>"And I took you for a sport! That shows how a fellow can be
  fooled. But you do play poker occasionally. I know that."</p>

  <p>"How do you know it, Mr. Bloodgood?"</p>

  <p>"By your language. You just spoke of going over the limit.
  That is a poker term."</p>

  <p>"And one used by many people who never played a game of cards
  in their lives."</p>

  <p>"But you have played cards? You have played poker? Can you
  deny it?"</p>

  <p>"If I could, I wouldn't take the trouble, Mr. Bloodgood. I
  think you have made a mistake in sizing up this crowd."</p>

  <p>"Guess I have," sneered the fellow. "You must be members of
  the Y.M.C.A."</p>

  <p>"Say, Frank!" panted Jack; "open the door and let
  me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>But Frank checked the hot-headed youth again.</p>

  <p>"Steady, Jack! It is not necessary. He will go directly. Mr.
  Bloodgood, you speak as if it were a disgrace to belong to the
  Y.M.C.A. That shows your ignorance and narrowness. The Y.M.C.A.
  is a splendid organization, and it has proved the anchor that has
  kept many a young man from dashing onto the rocks of destruction.
  Those who sneer at it should be ashamed of themselves, but, as a
  rule, they are too bigoted, prejudiced, or narrow-minded to
  recognize the fact that some of the most manly young men to be
  found belong to the Y.M.C.A."</p>

  <p>Bloodgood laughed.</p>

  <p>"And I took you for a sport!" he cried. "By Jove! Never made
  such a blunder before in all my life! Studying for the ministry,
  I'll wager! Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

  <p>Frank saw that Diamond could not be held in check much
  longer.</p>

  <p>"One last word to you, Mr. Bloodgood," he spoke. "I am not
  studying for the ministry, and I do not even belong to the
  Y.M.C.A. If I were doing the one or belonged to the other, I
  should not be ashamed of it. I don't like you. I can stand a
  little freshness; in fact, it rather pleases me; but you are
  altogether too fresh. You are offensive."</p>

  <p>Merry flung open the door.</p>

  <p>"Good-day, sir."</p>

  <p>Bloodgood stepped out, turned round, laughed, and then walked
  away.</p>

  <p>"Hang it, Merriwell!" grated Diamond, as Frank closed the
  door; "why didn't you let me kick him out onto his neck!"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>

  <h3>WHO IS BLOODGOOD?</h3>

  <p>Diamond was thoroughly angry. So was Rattleton. In his
  excitement, Harry said something that caused Frank to turn
  quickly, and observe:</p>

  <p>"Don't use that kind of language, old man, no matter what the
  provocation. Vulgarity is even lower than profanity."</p>

  <p>Harry's face flushed, and he looked intensely ashamed of
  himself.</p>

  <p>"I peg your bardon&mdash;I mean I beg your pardon!" he
  spluttered. "It slipped out. You know I don't say anything like
  that often."</p>

  <p>"I know it," nodded Frank, "and that's why it sounded all the
  worse. I don't know that I ever heard you use such a word
  before."</p>

  <p>Harry did not resent Frank's reproof, for he knew Frank was
  right, and he was ashamed.</p>

  <p>Every young man who stoops to vulgarity should be ashamed.
  Profanity is coarse and degrading; vulgarity is positively low
  and filthy. The youth who is careful to keep his clothes and his
  body clean should be careful to keep his mouth clean. Let nothing
  go into it or come out of it that is in any way lowering.</p>

  <p>Did you ever hear a loafer on a corner using profane and
  obscene language? I'll warrant most of you have, and I'll warrant
  that you were thoroughly disgusted. You looked on the fellow as
  low, coarse, cheap, unfit to associate with respectable persons.
  The next time you use a word that you should be ashamed to have
  your mother or sister hear just think that you are following the
  example of that loafer. You are lowering yourself in the eyes of
  somebody, even though you may not think so at the time. Perhaps
  one of your companions may be a person who uses such language
  freely, and yet he has never before heard it from you. He laughs,
  he calls you a jolly good fellow to your face; but he thinks to
  himself that you are no better than anybody else, and behind your
  back he tells somebody what he thinks. He is glad of the
  opportunity to show that you are no better than he is. Never tell
  a vulgar story. Better never listen to one, unless your position
  is such that you cannot escape without making yourself appear a
  positive cad. If you have to listen to such a story, forget it as
  soon as possible. Above all things, do not try to remember
  it.</p>

  <p>Some young men boast of the stories they know. And all their
  stories are of the "shady" sort. It is better to know no stories
  than to know that kind. It is better not to be called a good
  fellow than to win a reputation by always having a new story of
  the low sort ready on your tongue.</p>

  <p>There are other and better ways of winning a reputation as a
  good fellow. There are stories which are genuinely humorous and
  funny which are also clean. No matter how much of a laugh he may
  raise, any self-respecting person feels that he has lowered
  himself by telling a vulgar story. It is not so if he has told a
  clean story. He is satisfied with the laughter he has caused and
  with himself.</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell was called a good fellow. It was not often
  that he told a story, but when he did, it was a good one, and it
  was clean. He had an inimitable way of telling anything, and his
  stories were all the more effective because they came at rare
  intervals. He did not cheapen them by making them common.</p>

  <p>And never had anybody heard him tell a story that could prove
  offensive to the ears of a lady.</p>

  <p>Not that he had not been tempted to do so. Not that he had not
  heard such stories. He had been placed in positions where he
  could not help hearing them without making himself appear like a
  thorough cad.</p>

  <p>Frank's first attempt to tell a vulgar story had been the
  lesson that he needed. He was with a rather gay crowd of boys at
  the time, and several had told "shady" yarns, and then they had
  called for one from Frank. He started to tell one, working up to
  the point with all the skill of which he was capable. He had them
  breathless, ready to shout with laughter when the point was
  reached. He drew them on and on with all the skill of which he
  was capable. And then, just as the climax was reached, he
  suddenly realized just what he was about to say. A thought came
  to him that made his heart give a great jump.</p>

  <p>"What if my mother were listening?"</p>

  <p>That was the thought. His mother was dead, but her influence
  was over him. A second thought followed. Many times he had seemed
  to feel her hovering near. Perhaps she was listening! Perhaps she
  was hearing all that he was saying!</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell stopped and stood quite still. At first he was
  very pale, and then came a rush of blood to his face. He turned
  crimson with shame and hung his head.</p>

  <p>His companions looked at him in astonishment. They could not
  understand what had happened. Some of them cried, "Go on! go
  on!"</p>

  <p>After some seconds he tried to speak. At first he choked and
  could say nothing articulate. After a little, he muttered:</p>

  <p>"I can't go on&mdash;I can't finish the story! You'll have to
  excuse me, fellows! I'm not feeling well!"</p>

  <p>And he withdrew from the jolly party as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>From that day Frank Merriwell never attempted to tell a story
  that was in the slightest degree vulgar. He had learned his
  lesson, and he never forgot it.</p>

  <p>Some boys swagger, chew tobacco, talk vulgar, and swear
  because they do not wish to be called "sissies." They fancy such
  actions and language make them manly, but nothing could be a
  greater mistake.</p>

  <p>Frank did nothing of the sort, and all who knew him regarded
  him as thoroughly manly. Better to be called a "sissy" than to
  win reputed manliness at the cost of self-respect.</p>

  <p>Frank had forced those who would have regarded him with scorn
  to respect him. He could play baseball or football with the best
  of them; he could run, jump, swim, ride, and he excelled by sheer
  determination in almost everything he undertook. He would not be
  beaten. If defeated once, he did not rest, but prepared himself
  for another trial and went in to win or die. In this way he
  showed himself manly, and he commanded the respect of enemies as
  well as friends.</p>

  <p>Rattleton was ashamed of the language he had used after the
  departure of Bloodgood, and he did not attempt to excuse himself
  further. He lay back in his berth, looking sicker than ever.</p>

  <p>"I'd give ten dollars for the privilege of helping Mr.
  Bloodgood out with my foot!" hissed Jack Diamond. "Never saw
  anybody so fresh!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, I've seen lots of people just like him," grunted
  Browning, getting out a pipe and lighting it.</p>

  <p>"Don't smoke, Bruce!" groaned Rattleton, as the steamer gave
  an unusually heavy roll. "I'm sick enough now. That will make me
  worse."</p>

  <p>"Oh, we'll open the port."</p>

  <p>"Open the port!" laughed Frank. "And we just told Bloodgood we
  did not drink."</p>

  <p>"Port-hole, not port wine," said the big fellow, with a yawn.
  "We'll let in some fresh air."</p>

  <p>"We can't let in anything fresher than just went out,"
  declared the Virginian, as he flung open the round window that
  served to admit light and air.</p>

  <p>"There's something mighty queer about that fellow," said
  Frank. "Did you notice the diamonds he was wearing, fellows?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said Bruce, beginning to puff away at his new
  briarwood. "Regular eye-hitters they were."</p>

  <p>"Who knows they were genuine?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"Nobody here," admitted Frank. "It is impossible to
  distinguish some fake stones from real diamonds, unless you
  examine them closely. But, somehow, I have a fancy that those
  were genuine diamonds."</p>

  <p>"What makes you think so?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know just why I think so, but I do. Something tells
  me that for all of his swagger Bloodgood is a fellow who would
  scorn to wear paste diamonds."</p>

  <p>"What do you make out of the fellow, anyway?" asked Bruce.</p>

  <p>"I'm not able to size him up yet," admitted Frank. "I'm not
  certain whether he came of a good family or a bad one, but I'm
  inclined to fancy it was the former."</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know why you think so?" from Jack. "He did not
  show very good breeding."</p>

  <p>"But there is a certain something about his face that makes me
  believe he comes from a high-grade family. I think he has become
  lowered by associating with bad companions."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't care who or what he is," declared Jack; "if he
  gets fresh around me again, I'll crack him one for luck. I can't
  stand him for a cent!"</p>

  <p>"Better turn him over to me," murmured Bruce, dozily. "I'll
  sit on him."</p>

  <p>"And he'll think he's under an elephant," laughed Merry.
  "Bruce cooked M. Montfort, and I reckon he'd have less trouble to
  cook Mr. Bloodgood."</p>

  <p>At this moment there was a hesitating, uncertain knock on the
  door.</p>

  <p>"Another visitor, I wonder?" muttered Frank.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>

  <h3>THE SUPERSTITIOUS MAN.</h3>

  <p>A little man hesitated outside the door when it was opened. He
  had a sad, uncertain, mournful drab face, puckered into a
  peculiar expression about the mouth. He was dressed in black, but
  his clothes were not a very good fit or in the latest style. He
  fingered his hat nervously. His voice was faltering when he
  spoke.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I beg your pardon, gentlemen. I&mdash;I hope I am
  not&mdash;intruding?"</p>

  <p>He had not crossed the threshold. He seemed in doubt about the
  advisability of venturing in.</p>

  <p>There was something amusing in the appearance of the little
  man. Frank recognized a "character" in him, and Merry was
  interested immediately. He invited the little man in, and closed
  the door when that person had entered.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I know it's rather&mdash;rather&mdash;er&mdash;bold
  of me," said the stranger, apologetically. "But you know people
  on shipboard&mdash;er&mdash;take many&mdash;liberties."</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes, we know it!" muttered Diamond.</p>

  <p>Browning grunted and looked the little man over. He was a
  curiosity to Bruce.</p>

  <p>"What can we do for you, sir?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>The little man hesitated and looked around. He sidled over and
  put his hand on the partition.</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;ah&mdash;next room is occupied by
  the&mdash;er&mdash;the French gentleman, is it not?" he
  asked.</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I presume&mdash;presume, you know&mdash;that you are
  able to hear any&mdash;ah&mdash;conversation that may take place
  in that room, unless&mdash;er&mdash;the conversation
  is&mdash;guarded."</p>

  <p>"Not unless we take particular pains to listen," said Merry.
  "Even then, it is doubtful if we can hear anything plainly."</p>

  <p>"And we are not eavesdroppers," cut in Diamond. "We do not
  take pains to listen."</p>

  <p>"Oh, no&mdash;er&mdash;no, of course not!" exclaimed the
  singular stranger. "I&mdash;I didn't insinuate such a thing! Ha!
  ha! ha! The idea! But you
  know&mdash;sometimes&mdash;occasionally&mdash;persons hear things
  when they&mdash;er&mdash;do not try to hear."</p>

  <p>"Well, what in the world are you driving at?" asked Frank, not
  a little puzzled by the man's singular manner.</p>

  <p>"Well, you see, it's&mdash;this way: I&mdash;I don't care to
  be&mdash;overheard. I don't want anybody to&mdash;to think I'm
  prying into their&mdash;private business. You understand?"</p>

  <p>"I can't say that I do."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps I can make myself&mdash;er&mdash;clearer."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you can."</p>

  <p>"My name is&mdash;er&mdash;Slush&mdash;Peddington Slush."</p>

  <p>"Holy cats! what a name!" muttered Browning, while Rattleton
  grinned despite his sickness.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I'm taking a sea voyage&mdash;for&mdash;for my
  health," explained Mr. Slush. "That's why I didn't go over on
  a&mdash;a regular liner. This way I shall be longer at&mdash;at
  sea. See?"</p>

  <p>"And you are keeping us at sea by your lingering way in coming
  to a point," smiled Merry.</p>

  <p>"Eh?" said the little man. Then he seemed to comprehend, and
  he broke into a sudden cackle of laughter, which he shut off with
  startling suddenness, looking frightened.</p>

  <p>"Beg your pardon!" he exclaimed. "Quite&mdash;ah&mdash;rude of
  me. I don't do it&mdash;often."</p>

  <p>"You look as if it wouldn't hurt you to do it oftener," said
  Merry, frankly. "Laughter never hurt anyone."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I can't quite agree with&mdash;you, sir. I beg your
  pardon! No offense! I&mdash;I don't wish to be
  offensive&mdash;you understand. I once knew a man who died
  from&mdash;er&mdash;laughing. It is a fact, sir. He laughed so
  long&mdash;and so hard&mdash;-that he&mdash;he lost his
  breath&mdash;entirely. Never got it back again. Since then I've
  been very&mdash;cautious. It's a bad sign to laugh&mdash;too
  hard."</p>

  <p>Merry felt like shouting, but Jack was looking puzzled and
  dazed. Diamond could not comprehend the little man, and he failed
  to catch the humor of the character.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Mr. Slush, "I will come directly to
  the&mdash;point."</p>

  <p>"Do," nodded Frank.</p>

  <p>"I just saw a&mdash;er&mdash;person leave this room. I wish to
  know if&mdash;Good gracious, sir! Do you know that is a bad
  sign!"</p>

  <p>He pointed a wavering finger at Frank.</p>

  <p>"What is a bad sign?" asked Merry, surprised.</p>

  <p>"To wear a&mdash;a dagger pin thrust through a&mdash;a tie in
  which there is the least bit of&mdash;red. It is a sign
  of&mdash;of bloodshed. I&mdash;I beg you to remove
  that&mdash;that pin from that scarf!"</p>

  <p>The little man seemed greatly agitated.</p>

  <p>After a moment of hesitation, Frank laughed lightly and took
  the pin from the scarf.</p>

  <p>Immediately the visitor seemed to breathe more freely.</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;thank you!" he said. "I&mdash;I've seen
  omens enough. Everything seems to point to&mdash;to
  a&mdash;tragedy. I regret exceedingly that I ever sailed&mdash;on
  this steamer. I&mdash;I shall be thankful when I put my feet on
  dry land&mdash;if I ever do again."</p>

  <p>"You must be rather superstitious," suggested Frank.</p>

  <p>"Not at all&mdash;that is, not to any extent," Mr. Slush
  hastened to aver. "There are a few signs&mdash;and
  omens&mdash;which I know&mdash;will come true."</p>

  <p>"Indeed!"</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir!" asserted the little man, with surprising
  positiveness. "I know something will happen&mdash;to this boat.
  I&mdash;I am positive of it."</p>

  <p>"Why are you so positive?"</p>

  <p>"Everything foretells it. At the very start it
  was&mdash;foretold. I was foolish then that I did not
  demand&mdash;demand, sir&mdash;to be set ashore, even after the
  steamer had left&mdash;her pier."</p>

  <p>"How was that?"</p>

  <p>"There was a cat, sir&mdash;a poor, stray cat&mdash;that came
  aboard this steamer. They did not let her stay&mdash;understand
  me? They&mdash;they drove her off!"</p>

  <p>"And that was a bad omen?"</p>

  <p>"Bad! It was&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;frightful! Old sailors
  will tell you that. Always&mdash;er&mdash;let a cat remain on
  board a vessel&mdash;if&mdash;she&mdash;comes on board. If
  you&mdash;if you do not&mdash;you will regret it."</p>

  <p>"And you think something must happen to this steamer?"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid so&mdash;I feel it. There is&mdash;something
  mysterious about the vessel, gentlemen. I don't know&mdash;just
  what it is&mdash;but it's something. The&mdash;the captain looks
  worried. I&mdash;I've noticed it. I've talked with him. Couldn't
  get any satisfaction&mdash;out of him. But I&mdash;I know!"</p>

  <p>"I'm afraid you are a croaker," said Diamond, unable to keep
  still longer.</p>

  <p>"You may think so&mdash;now; but wait and see&mdash;wait. Keep
  your eyes&mdash;open. I&mdash;I think you will see something. I
  think you will find there are&mdash;mysterious things going
  on."</p>

  <p>"Well, you have not told us what you want of us, Mr. Slush,"
  said Frank.</p>

  <p>"That's so&mdash;forgot it." Then, of a sudden, to Bruce:
  "Don't twirl your thumbs&mdash;that way. Do it
  backward&mdash;backward! It&mdash;it's a sure sign
  of&mdash;disaster to twirl your thumbs&mdash;forward."</p>

  <p>"All right," grunted the big fellow; "backward it is." And he
  reversed the motion.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," breathed Mr. Slush, with a show of relief. "Now,
  I'll tell you&mdash;why I called. I&mdash;er&mdash;saw a young
  man&mdash;leaving this room&mdash;a few minutes ago."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"Mr. Bloodgood."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I have taken an interest in&mdash;Mr. Bloodgood.
  I&mdash;I think he is&mdash;a rather nice young man."</p>

  <p>"I don't admire your taste," came from Jack.</p>

  <p>"Eh? I don't know him&mdash;very well. You understand. Met
  him&mdash;in the smoking-room. Sometimes I&mdash;er&mdash;play
  cards&mdash;for amusement. Met him that way."</p>

  <p>"Does he play for amusement?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes&mdash;ah&mdash;of course. That is&mdash;he&mdash;he
  likes&mdash;a little stake."</p>

  <p>"I thought so."</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I don't mind that."</p>

  <p>"Great Scott!" thought Merry. "I don't see how he ever gets
  round to play cards for money. I shouldn't think he'd know what
  to do. It would take him so long to make up his mind."</p>

  <p>"But I&mdash;I don't care to make a&mdash;a companion of
  anybody about whom I know&mdash;nothing. That's why I&mdash;came
  to you. I&mdash;I thought it might be you could give
  me&mdash;some information&mdash;about Mr. Bloodgood."</p>

  <p>"You've come to the wrong place."</p>

  <p>"Really? Don't you know&mdash;anything about him? You
  are&mdash;er&mdash;well acquainted with him?"</p>

  <p>"On the contrary, to-day is the first time we have ever spoken
  to him."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" said Mr. Slush, in evident disappointment. "You
  are&mdash;er&mdash;young men about&mdash;about his age,
  and&mdash;and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Not in his class," put in Diamond.</p>

  <p>"No?" said Mr. Slush, looking at Jack queerly. "I didn't
  know&mdash;I thought&mdash;"</p>

  <p>There the queer little man stopped, seeming quite unable to
  proceed. Then, in his hesitating, uncertain way, he tried to make
  it clear that he did not care to play cards for money with
  anybody about whom he knew nothing. He was not very effective in
  his explanation, and seemed himself rather uncertain concerning
  his real reason for wishing to make inquiries concerning
  Bloodgood.</p>

  <p>Frank studied Mr. Slush closely, but could not take the
  measure of the man. Somehow, Merry seemed to feel that there was
  more to the queer little fellow than appeared on the surface.</p>

  <p>"Well, you have come to the wrong parties to get information
  about Mr. Bloodgood," said Frank. "But, if you are so particular
  about your company, it might be well to learn something
  concerning the other members of your party."</p>

  <p>"Oh&mdash;er&mdash;I know all about them," asserted Mr.
  Slush.</p>

  <p>"Indeed?"</p>

  <p>"Yes. Hugh Hazleton is the younger son of an English nobleman,
  and he is&mdash;is all&mdash;right."</p>

  <p>"Who told you this?"</p>

  <p>"He did."</p>

  <p>"Then it must be true," grunted Browning, with a grin on his
  broad face.</p>

  <p>"Yes," nodded the little man, innocently, "that
  is&mdash;ah&mdash;settled. M. Rouen Montfort is a&mdash;a great
  French journalist and&mdash;er&mdash;writer of books."</p>

  <p>"Is that so?" smiled Merry. "Queer, I never heard of him. I
  suppose he told you this?"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes. He is a very fine&mdash;gentleman. Ah&mdash;did Mr.
  Bloodgood invite&mdash;er&mdash;any of you to come into
  the&mdash;ah&mdash;game?"</p>

  <p>Frank fancied he saw a sudden light. Was it possible Mr. Slush
  was looking for "suckers?"</p>

  <p>Was it possible he had been sent there to inveigle them into
  the party, so that some sharp might "skin" them? It did not seem
  improbable.</p>

  <p>Harry seemed to catch onto the same idea, for he popped up in
  his bunk suddenly, but a sudden roll of the steamer caused him to
  sink down again with a groan.</p>

  <p>Diamond's eyes began to glitter. He, too, fancied he saw the
  little game.</p>

  <p>"No," said Merry, slowly, "he did not invite any of us to come
  in."</p>

  <p>The little man seemed relieved.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I didn't know," he faltered. "If he
  had&mdash;I&mdash;I was going to say something. Perhaps it is
  not&mdash;necessary."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not," said Frank; "but it may not do any hurt to say
  it."</p>

  <p>"And it may do some hurt&mdash;to you," muttered Diamond under
  his breath. "I will kick this fellow!"</p>

  <p>But, to the surprise of all, the superstitious man cackled out
  a short, broken laugh, and said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, I was going to&mdash;to warn you&mdash;that's all.
  It&mdash;it's liable to be a pretty&mdash;stiff game. I thought
  it would be a&mdash;good thing for you to&mdash;keep out of it.
  It started&mdash;light, but it's working&mdash;up&mdash;right
  along. Almost any time somebody is liable to&mdash;to propose
  throwing off the&mdash;the limit, and then somebody is going to
  get&mdash;hurt. If you are&mdash;not in it, why you won't be in
  any&mdash;danger."</p>

  <p>There was a silence. The four youths looked at the visitor and
  then at each other.</p>

  <p>What did it mean?</p>

  <p>If he was playing them for "suckers," surely he was doing it
  in a queer manner.</p>

  <p>"Thank you," said Frank, stiffly. "You are kind!"</p>

  <p>"More than kind!" muttered Diamond.</p>

  <p>"Don't mention it," said the little man, trying to look
  pleasant, but making a dismal failure. "I&mdash;I dont' like to
  see respectable young men caught in a&mdash;trap. That's all.
  Thought I'd tell you. Didn't know that you would&mdash;thank me.
  Took my chances on that. Well, I think I'll&mdash;be going."</p>

  <p>He turned, falteringly, seemed about to say something more,
  opened the door part way, hesitated, then said "good-day," and
  went out.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>

  <h3>THE CARGO OF THE "EAGLE."</h3>

  <p>"Well?"</p>

  <p>"Well!"</p>

  <p>"Well!"</p>

  <p>The same word, but from three different persons, and spoken in
  three different inflections.</p>

  <p>"Will somebody please hit me with something hard!" murmured
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"What does it mean, Merry?" asked Rattleton.</p>

  <p>"You may search me!" exclaimed Frank, in rather expressive
  slang, something in which he seldom indulged, unless under great
  provocation.</p>

  <p>Browning had said nothing. He was pulling steadily at his
  pipe, quite unaware that it had gone out.</p>

  <p>"What do you make of Mr. Peddington Slush?" asked Jack.</p>

  <p>"I don't know what to make of him," confessed Frank. "About
  the only thing of which I am sure is that he has a corker for a
  name. That name is enough to make any man look sad and
  dejected."</p>

  <p>"What did he come here for, anyhow?" asked Rattleton.</p>

  <p>"To find out about Raymond Bloodgood&mdash;he said."</p>

  <p>"I know he said so, but I don't stake any talk&mdash;I mean
  take any stock in that. What difference does it make to him who
  Bloodgood is?"</p>

  <p>"That was something he did not make clear."</p>

  <p>"He didn't seem to make anything clear," declared Jack. "I
  thought for sure that he was going to throw out some hooks to
  drag us into that game of poker. If he had, I should have known
  he was sent here, and I'd kicked him out, whether you had been
  willing or not, Merry!"</p>

  <p>"I'd opened the door and held it wide for you," smiled
  Frank.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of him, Browning?" asked Harry.</p>

  <p>"His way of talking made me very tired," yawned the big
  fellow. "He seemed to work so hard to get anything out."</p>

  <p>"I'll allow that we have had two rather queer visitors," said
  the Virginian.</p>

  <p>"And I shall take an interest in them both after this,"
  declared Frank.</p>

  <p>"Talk about superstitious persons, I believe he heads the
  list," from Jack.</p>

  <p>"He said he was not superstitious," laughed Merry.</p>

  <p>"But the cat worried him."</p>

  <p>"And my twiddling my thumbs," put in Bruce.</p>

  <p>"And this dagger pin in my scarf," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"It's a wonder he didn't prophecy shipwreck, or something of
  that sort," groaned Rattleton, who had settled at full length in
  his berth. "If this rolling motion keeps up, I shall get so I
  won't care if we are wrecked."</p>

  <p>"He must be a dandy in a good swift game of poker!" laughed
  Frank. "I shouldn't think he'd be able to make up his mind how to
  discard. He'd be a drawback to the game, or I'm much
  mistaken."</p>

  <p>"It strikes me that he'd be easy fruit," said Rattleton.</p>

  <p>"He looks like a 'sucker' himself, but sometimes it is
  impossible to tell about a man till after you see him play.
  Anyhow, these two visits were something to break the monotony of
  the voyage. It promised to be pretty lively at the start, but it
  has settled down to be rather quiet."</p>

  <p>Bloodgood and Slush proved good food for conversation, but the
  boys tired of that after a while.</p>

  <p>Diamond went out by himself, and Frank went to Tutor Maybe's
  room, where he spent the time till the gong sounded for
  supper.</p>

  <p>"Come, Harry," said Frank, appearing in the stateroom, "aren't
  you ready for supper?"</p>

  <p>Rattleton gave a groan.</p>

  <p>"Don't talk to me about eating!" he exclaimed. "It makes me
  sick to think about it. Leave me&mdash;let me die in peace!"</p>

  <p>Jack was not there, so Frank and Bruce washed up and went out
  together. They were nearly through eating when the Virginian came
  in and took his place near them at the table.</p>

  <p>Usually the captain sat at the head of that table, but he was
  not there now.</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?" asked Frank.</p>

  <p>"Getting onto a few things," said Jack, in a peculiar way.</p>

  <p>"Why, what's the matter with you?" asked Bruce, pausing to
  stare at the Southerner. "You are pale as a ghost!"</p>

  <p>"Am I?" said Diamond, his voice sounding rather strained and
  unnatural.</p>

  <p>"Sure thing. I wouldn't advise you to eat any more, and
  perhaps you hadn't better look at the chandeliers while they are
  swinging. You'll be keeping Rattleton company."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I'm not sick&mdash;at least, not seasick," averred
  Jack.</p>

  <p>"Then what ails you? I was going to prescribe ginger ale if it
  was the first stage of seasickness. Sometimes that will brace a
  person up and straighten out his stomach."</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't talk remedies to me. I took medicine three days
  before I started on this voyage, and everybody I saw told me
  something to do to keep from being sick. I'm wearing a sheet of
  writing paper across my chest now."</p>

  <p>When supper was over Jack motioned for his friends to follow
  him. The three went on deck and walked aft till they were quite
  alone.</p>

  <p>The "Eagle" was plowing along over a deserted sea. The waves
  were running heavily, and night was shutting down grimly over the
  ocean.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you, Diamond?" asked Browning. "Why
  have you dragged us out here? It's cold, and I'd rather go into
  our stateroom and take a loaf after eating so heartily. By Jove!
  if this keeps up, they won't have provisions enough on this boat
  to feed me before we get across."</p>

  <p>"I wanted to have a little talk without," said Jack; "and I
  didn't care about talking in the stateroom, where I might be
  overheard."</p>

  <p>"What's up, anyway?" demanded Frank, warned by the manner of
  the Virginian that Jack fancied he had something of importance to
  tell them.</p>

  <p>"I've been investigating," said Jack.</p>

  <p>"What?"</p>

  <p>"Well, I found out that there is something the matter on this
  boat."</p>

  <p>"Did you learn what it was?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know that I have, but I've discovered one thing. I've
  learned the kind of cargo we carry."</p>

  <p>"What is it?"</p>

  <p>"Petroleum and powder!"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

  <h3>PREMONITIONS OF PERIL.</h3>

  <p>"Well, that's hot stuff when it's burning," said Merriwell,
  grimly.</p>

  <p>"Rather!" grunted Browning.</p>

  <p>"If I'd known what the old boat carried, I think I'd hesitated
  some about shipping on her," declared Jack. "What if she did get
  on fire?"</p>

  <p>"We'd all go up in smoke," said Merriwell, with absolute
  coolness. "That is about the size of it."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jack, "I heard two of the sailors talking in a
  very mysterious manner. They say the 'Eagle' is hoodooed and the
  captain knows it. They say he has not slept any to speak of since
  we left New York."</p>

  <p>"Sailors are always superstitious. They are ignorant, as a
  rule, and ignorance breeds superstition."</p>

  <p>"Do you consider Mr. Slush ignorant?" asked Bruce.</p>

  <p>"Didn't have time to size him up, but he's queer."</p>

  <p>"I shall feel that I am over a volcano during the rest of the
  voyage," said Jack. "What if there was somebody on board who
  wished to destroy the ship?"</p>

  <p>"It wouldn't be much of a job," grunted Browning. "A match
  touched to a powder keg would do the trick in a hurry."</p>

  <p>"But he'd go up with the rest of us," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"Unless he used a slow match," put in Jack. "These captains
  always have their enemies, who are desperate fellows and ready to
  do almost anything to injure them. The steamer might be set afire
  by means of a slow match, which would give the villain time
  enough to get away."</p>

  <p>"I hardly think there's anybody desperate enough to do that
  kind of a trick, for it would be a case of suicide."</p>

  <p>"Perhaps not. The chap who did the trick might have some plan
  of escaping. Then I have known men desperate enough to commit
  suicide if they could destroy an enemy at the same time."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's likely all this worry about this vessel and cargo
  is entirely needless and foolish."</p>

  <p>"I don't believe it," said the Virginian. "I know now that the
  captain has been worried. I have noticed it in his manner. He is
  pale and restless."</p>

  <p>"Well, it's likely he may be rather anxious, for it's certain
  he cannot carry any insurance on such a cargo."</p>

  <p>"He was not at the table to-night."</p>

  <p>"No."</p>

  <p>"I'd give something to be on solid ground and away from this
  powder mill. You know that sometimes there is such a thing as an
  unaccountable explosion. A heavy sea must cause motion or
  friction in the cargo, and friction often starts a fire on
  shipboard. Fire on this vessel means a quick road to glory."</p>

  <p>"Huah!" grunted Bruce. "I'm not in the habit of worrying about
  things that may happen. It's cold out here. Let's go back to the
  stateroom."</p>

  <p>"It will be well enough to keep still about the nature of the
  cargo, Diamond," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I shall keep still about that all right!" assured
  Jack.</p>

  <p>As they moved back along the deck they discovered somebody who
  was leaning over the rail and making all sorts of dismal sounds
  and groans.</p>

  <p>"The next time I go to Europe I'll stay at home!" moaned this
  individual. "Oh, my! oh, my! How bad I feel! Next that comes will
  be the shaps of my twos&mdash;I mean the taps of my shoes!"</p>

  <p>"It's Rattles!" laughed Frank, softly; "and he is sicker than
  ever. He's tried to crawl out to get some air."</p>

  <p>At this moment a man opened the door near Rattleton, and
  asked:</p>

  <p>"Is the&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;moon up yet?"</p>

  <p>"I don't know," moaned Harry. "But it is if I swallowed it.
  Everything else is up, anyhow."</p>

  <p>"If the&mdash;ah&mdash;moon comes up red tonight, it will
  mean&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"I don't give a rap what it means!" snorted Rattleton. "Don't
  talk to me! Let me die without torturing me! I'm sick enough
  without having you make me worse!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Slush, for he was the anxious inquirer about the moon,
  dodged back into the cabin, closing the door hesitatingly.</p>

  <p>Then Rattleton, unaware of the proximity of his amused
  friends, hung over the rail and groaned again.</p>

  <p>Frank walked up and spoke:</p>

  <p>"I see, my dear boy, that you are heeding the Bible
  admonition."</p>

  <p>"Hey?" groaned Harry. "What is it?"</p>

  <p>"'Cast thy bread upon the waters!' You are doing it all right,
  all right."</p>

  <p>"Now, don't carry this thing too far!" Rattleton tried to say
  in a fierce manner, but his fierceness was laughable. "The worm
  will turn when trodden upon."</p>

  <p>"But the banana peel knows a trick worth two of that. Did you
  ever hear that touching little poem about the man who stepped on
  a banana peel? Never did? Why, that is too bad! You don't know
  what you've missed. Listen, and you shall hear it."</p>

  <p>Then Frank solemnly declaimed:</p>
  <pre>
     "He walked along one summer day,
       As stately as a prince;
     He stepped upon a banana peel,
       And he hasn't 'banana' where since."
</pre>

  <p>Rattleton gave a still more dismal groan.</p>

  <p>"You are conspiring with the elements to hasten my death!" he
  said. "I can't stand many more like that."</p>

  <p>"You should wear a sheet of writing paper across your breast,
  same as I do," said Diamond. "Then you won't be sick."</p>

  <p>"I've got two sheets of writing paper across mine," declared
  Harry.</p>

  <p>"You should drink a bottle of ginger ale to settle your
  stomach," put in Frank.</p>

  <p>"Just drank three bottles of ginger ale, and they've turned my
  stomach wrong side out," gurgled the sick youth.</p>

  <p>"You should allow yourself perfect relaxation, and not try to
  fight against it," from Browning.</p>

  <p>"Oh, I haven't allowed myself anything else but perfect
  relaxation," came from Harry. "You all make me tired!"</p>

  <p>Then he staggered into the cabin and disappeared on his way
  back to the stateroom.</p>

  <p>Diamond and Browning followed, but Frank lingered behind.</p>

  <p>Although he had kept the fact concealed, Merry was troubled
  with a strange foreboding of coming disaster. In every way he
  tried to overcome anything like superstition, but he remembered
  that, on many other occasions, he had been warned of coming
  trouble by just such feelings.</p>

  <p>"I'd like to know just what is going on upon this steamer," he
  muttered, as he walked forward. "I feel as if something was
  wrong, and I shall not be satisfied till I investigate."</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

  <h3>IN THE STOKE-HOLE.</h3>

  <p>Frank found the chief engineer taking some air. Merry fell
  into conversation with the man, who was smoking and seemed quite
  willing to talk.</p>

  <p>Having a pleasant and agreeable way, Frank easily led the
  engineer on, and it was not long before the man was quite taken
  with the chatty passenger.</p>

  <p>Frank was careful not to seem inquisitive or prying, for he
  knew it would be easy to arouse the engineer's suspicions if
  there should be anything wrong on the steamer.</p>

  <p>However, Merry was working for a privilege, and he obtained
  it. When he expressed a desire to go below and have a look at the
  engines and furnaces, the engineer invited him to come along.</p>

  <p>They passed through a door, and then began a descent by means
  of iron ladders. The clanking roar of the machinery came up to
  them. Frank could hear and feel the throbbing heart beats of the
  great boat.</p>

  <p>The engine room was quickly reached, and there the engineer
  showed him the massive machinery that moved with the regularity
  of clockwork and the grace and ease that came from great power
  and perfect adjustment.</p>

  <p>All this was interesting, but Frank was anxious to go still
  deeper.</p>

  <p>"Go ahead," said the engineer, showing him the way. "Down that
  ladder there. You'll be able to see the furnaces and the stokers
  at work. I don't believe you'll care to go into the
  stoke-hole."</p>

  <p>Frank descended. Great heat came up to him, accompanied by a
  glow that shifted and changed, dying down suddenly at one moment
  and glaring out at the next. He could hear the ring of shovels
  and the clank of iron doors.</p>

  <p>He reached an iron grating, where a fierce heat rolled up and
  seemed to scorch him. From that position he could look down into
  the stoke-hole and see the black, grimy, sweating, half-clad men
  at work there.</p>

  <p>Above him, at the head of the ladder he had just descended, a
  pair of shining eyes glared down, but he saw them not. He had not
  observed a cleaner who was at work on the machinery in the
  engine-room, and who kept his hat pulled over his eyes till Frank
  departed.</p>

  <p>The blackened stokers looked like grim demons of the fiery pit
  as they labored at the coal, which they were shoveling into the
  mouths of the greedy furnaces.</p>

  <p>The shifting glow was caused by the opening and closing of the
  furnace doors, which clanged and rang.</p>

  <p>For a moment the pit below would seem shrouded in almost
  Stygian darkness, save for some bar of light that gleamed out
  from a crack or draft, and then there would be a rattle of iron
  and a flare of blood-red light that came with the flinging open
  of a furnace door.</p>

  <p>In the glare of light the bare-armed, dirt-grimed stokers
  would shovel, shovel, shovel, till it seemed a wonder that the
  fire was not completely deadened by so much coal.</p>

  <p>Sometimes the doors of all the furnaces would seem open at
  once, and the glare and heat that came up from the place was
  something awful.</p>

  <p>Merry wondered how human beings could live down there in that
  terrible place.</p>

  <p>Some of the men were raking out ashes and hoisting it by means
  of a mechanism provided for the purpose.</p>

  <p>Frank pitied the poor creatures who were forced to work down
  in that place. Yet he remembered it was not so many months since
  he had applied for the position of wiper in an engine
  round-house, obtained the job, and worked there with the grimiest
  and lowest employees of the railroad.</p>

  <p>There was something fascinating in the black pit and the grimy
  men who labored down there in the glare and heat. Frank was so
  absorbed that he heard no sound, received no warning of
  danger.</p>

  <p>Merry leaned out over the edge of the iron grating. Something
  struck on his back, he was clutched, thrust out, hurled from the
  grating!</p>

  <p>It was done in a twinkling. He could not defend himself, but
  he made a clutch to save himself, caught something, swung in,
  struck against the iron ladder, and went tumbling and sliding
  downward.</p>

  <p>At the moment when Frank was attacked, a glare of light had
  filled the pit. One of the stokers had turned his back to the
  gleaming mouths of the furnaces and looked upward, as if to
  relieve his aching eyes.</p>

  <p>He saw everything that occurred on the grating. He saw a man
  slip down the ladder behind Frank and spring on his back. He saw
  that man hurl Frank from the grating.</p>

  <p>The stoker uttered a shout and ran toward the foot of the
  ladder, expecting to find Frank laying there, severely injured or
  killed. He was astounded when he saw the ready-witted youth grasp
  the grating, swing in, strike the ladder, cling and slide.</p>

  <p>Down Frank came with a rush, but he did not fall. He landed in
  the stoke-hole without being severely injured. He was on his feet
  in a twinkling, and up that ladder he went like a cat.</p>

  <p>His assailant had darted up the ladder above and disappeared.
  Merry reached the grating from which he had been hurled, and then
  he ran up the other ladder.</p>

  <p>He was soon in the engine-room.</p>

  <p>In that room there was no excitement. The machinery was
  sliding and swinging in a regular manner, while the engineer sat
  watching its movements, talking to an assistant. Oilers and
  cleaners were at work.</p>

  <p>"Where is he?" cried Frank, his voice sounding clear and
  distinct.</p>

  <p>They looked at him in amazement.</p>

  <p>"What's the matter?" asked the engineer, coming forward.</p>

  <p>"I was attacked from behind and thrown into the stoke-hole,"
  Merry explained. "The fellow who did it came in here."</p>

  <p>"Thrown into the stoke-hole?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"From where?"</p>

  <p>"The grating at the foot of the first ladder."</p>

  <p>The engineer looked doubtful.</p>

  <p>"My dear fellow," he said, "you would have been maimed or
  killed. You do not seem to be harmed."</p>

  <p>Frank realized that the engineer actually doubted his
  word.</p>

  <p>"He might have fallen," said the assistant; "but it would have
  broken his neck."</p>

  <p>"I tell you I was attacked from behind and thrown down!"
  exclaimed Frank. "I managed to get hold of the ladder and slide,
  so I was not killed."</p>

  <p>The engineer looked annoyed.</p>

  <p>"This is what comes of letting a passenger in here," he said.
  "It's the last time I'll do it on my own responsibility. Now if
  you go out and tell you were thrown into the stoke-hole, there'll
  be any amount of fuss over it."</p>

  <p>"I am telling it right here," said Frank, grimly, "and I want
  to know who did the trick. Somebody who came from this room must
  have done it."</p>

  <p>"Impossible!"</p>

  <p>"Then where did he come from?"</p>

  <p>The engineer and his assistant looked at each other, and the
  former began to swear.</p>

  <p>"What do you think of it, Joe?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"Think you made a mistake, Bill; but his story won't go.
  Nobody'll take any stock in it."</p>

  <p>Frank was angry. It was something unusual for his word to be
  doubted, and he felt like expressing his feelings decidedly.</p>

  <p>He was saved the trouble. The grimy stoker who had witnessed
  the struggle and the fall appeared in the door of the
  engine-room. He saw Frank and cried:</p>

  <p>"Hello, you! So you're all right? Wonder you wasn't killed.
  You came down with a rush, young feller, but you went back just
  as quick."</p>

  <p>Frank understood instantly.</p>

  <p>"Here is a man who saw it!" he cried. "He will tell you that I
  am not lying."</p>

  <p>The engineer turned to the stoker.</p>

  <p>"How did he happen to fall?" he asked.</p>

  <p>"He didn't fall," declared the begrimed coal heaver.</p>

  <p>"No? What then&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"'Nother chap jumped on his back and flung him down. It's
  wonderful he wasn't killed."</p>

  <p>Frank was triumphant. He regarded the engineer and his
  assistant with a grim smile on his face.</p>

  <p>"This is incredible!" exclaimed the engineer. "Who could have
  done such a thing?"</p>

  <p>"Somebody who came from this room!" rang out Merry's clear
  voice.</p>

  <p>"This shall be investigated!" declared the engineer. "Look
  around! See if you can find the man who attacked you. The only
  ones here are myself, Mr. Gregory, and the wipers."</p>

  <p>"I want a look at those wipers," said Frank.</p>

  <p>"You shall have it. Mr. Gregory and I were talking together
  over here all the time you were gone."</p>

  <p>"Oh, I do not suspect you," said Merry; "but I want a good
  look at those wipers."</p>

  <p>"Did you see the man who threw you into the stoke-hole?"</p>

  <p>"No, but&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Then how will you know who it was if you see him?"</p>

  <p>"Whoever did so had a reason for the act&mdash;a motive. He
  must have known me before. I may know him."</p>

  <p>"Come," invited the engineer.</p>

  <p>He called one of the wipers down from amid the sliding shafts
  and moving machinery. The man came unhesitatingly.</p>

  <p>Frank took a square look at this man, who did not seek to
  avoid inspection.</p>

  <p>"Never saw him before," confessed Merry.</p>

  <p>The wiper was dismissed.</p>

  <p>"Hackett," called the engineer.</p>

  <p>The other wiper did not seem to hear. He pretended to be very
  busy, and kept at work.</p>

  <p>"Hackett!"</p>

  <p>He could not fail to hear that. He kept his face turned away,
  but answered:</p>

  <p>"Yes, sir."</p>

  <p>"Come here. I want you."</p>

  <p>The wiper hesitated. Then he turned and slowly approached. His
  face was besmeared till scarcely a bit of natural color showed,
  and his hat was pulled low over his eyes. He shambled forward
  awkwardly, and stood in an awkward position, with his eyes cast
  down.</p>

  <p>Frank looked at him closely and started. Then, in a perfectly
  calm manner, but with a trace of triumph in his voice, he
  declared:</p>

  <p>"This is the fellow who did the job!"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

  <h3>IN IRONS.</h3>

  <p>"What?" cried the engineer, in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"How do you know?" asked the engineer's assistant,
  incredulously.</p>

  <p>"That's it&mdash;how do you know?" demanded the engineer. "You
  said you did not see the person who attacked you."</p>

  <p>"I did not."</p>

  <p>"Yet you say this is the man."</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"How do you know?"</p>

  <p>"I know him."</p>

  <p>"You do?"</p>

  <p>"Yes."</p>

  <p>"You have seen him before?"</p>

  <p>"I should say so, on several occasions. He is one of my
  bitterest enemies. This is not the first time he has tried to
  kill or injure me. He has made the attempt many times before. He
  is the only person here who would do such a thing."</p>

  <p>"If this is true," said the engineer, grimly, "he shall pay
  dearly for his work!"</p>

  <p>The assistant nodded.</p>

  <p>"What have you to say, Hackett?" demanded the engineer.</p>

  <p>"I say it's a lie!" growled the fellow. "I never saw this chap
  before he came into the engine-room. He doesn't know me, and I
  don't know him."</p>

  <p>"You hear what Hackett has to say," said the engineer, turning
  to Frank.</p>

  <p>"I hear what this fellow has to say, but his name is not
  Hackett."</p>

  <p>"Is not?"</p>

  <p>"No, no more than mine is Hackett."</p>

  <p>"Then what is his name?"</p>

  <p>"His name is Harris!" asserted Merry, "and he is a gambler and
  a crook. I'll guarantee that he has not been long on the
  'Eagle.'"</p>

  <p>"No; we took him on in New York scarcely two hours before we
  sailed. We needed a man, and he applied for any kind of a job.
  Found he had worked round machinery, and we took him as wiper and
  general assistant."</p>

  <p>"It was not so many weeks ago that he attacked me at New
  Haven," said Frank. "He failed to do me harm. When he found I was
  going abroad he declared he would go along on the same steamer.
  At the time he must have thought I was going by one of the
  regular liners; but it is plain he followed me up pretty close
  and found I was going over this way. As there is no second-class
  passage on this boat, he decided he could not travel in the same
  class with me without being discovered, and he resolved to go as
  one of the crew, if he could get on that way. That's how he
  happens to be here."</p>

  <p>"If what you say is true, it will go pretty hard with Mr.
  Harris. We'll have him ironed and&mdash;"</p>

  <p>A cry of rage broke from the lips of the accused.</p>

  <p>"There is no proof!" he snarled. "No one can swear I attacked
  this fellow and threw him into the stoke-hole!"</p>

  <p>"Oh, yes!" said the stoker who had come up from below. "I saw
  the whole business. By the light from the furnaces, I plainly saw
  the man who did it, and you are the man!"</p>

  <p>"That settles it!" declared the engineer. "You'll make the
  rest of the voyage in irons, Mr. Harris!"</p>

  <p>"Then I'll give you something to iron me for!" shouted the
  furious young villain.</p>

  <p>He leaped on Frank Merriwell with the fierceness of a wounded
  tiger.</p>

  <p>Frank was not expecting the assault, and, for the moment, he
  was taken off his guard.</p>

  <p>They were close to the moving machinery. Within four feet of
  them a huge plunging rod was playing up and down, moved by a
  steel bar that weighed many tons. Harris attempted to fling Frank
  beneath this bar, where he would be struck and crushed.</p>

  <p>The villain nearly succeeded, so swift and savage was his
  attack.</p>

  <p>Frank realized that the purpose of the wretch was to fling him
  into the machinery, and he braced himself to resist as quickly as
  possible.</p>

  <p>Shouts of consternation broke from the engineer and his
  assistant. They sprang forward to seize Harris and help
  Frank.</p>

  <p>But, before they could interfere, Frank broke the hold of his
  enemy, forced him back and struck him a terrible blow between the
  eyes felling him instantly.</p>

  <p>Merriwell stood over Harris, his hands clenched his eyes
  gleaming.</p>

  <p>"Get up!" he cried. "Get up you dog! I can't strike you when
  you are down, and I'd give a hundred dollars to hit you just once
  more!"</p>

  <p>But Harris did not get up. He realized that his second attempt
  had failed, and he stood in awe of Frank's terrible fists. He
  looked up at those gleaming eyes, and turned away quickly,
  feeling a sudden great fear.</p>

  <p>Did Frank Merriwell bear a charmed life?</p>

  <p>Surely it seemed that way to Harris just then. For the first
  time, perhaps, the young rascal began to believe that it was not
  possible to harm the lad he hated with all the intensity of his
  nature.</p>

  <p>The engineer and his assistants grabbed Harris and held him,
  the former swearing savagely. They dragged the fellow to his
  feet, but warned him to stand still.</p>

  <p>Harris did so. For the moment, at least, he was completely
  cowed.</p>

  <p>A man was sent for the captain, with instructions to tell him
  just what occurred. Of course the captain of the steamer was the
  only person who could order one of the men placed in irons.</p>

  <p>The captain came in in a little while, and he listened in
  great amazement to the story of what had taken place. His face
  was hard and grim. He asked Frank a few questions, and then he
  ordered that Harris be ironed and confined in the hold.</p>

  <p>"Mr. Merriwell," said the captain, "I am very sorry that this
  happened on my ship."</p>

  <p>"It's all right, captain," said Frank. "You are in no way to
  blame. The fellow shipped with the intention of doing just what
  he did, if he found an opportunity."</p>

  <p>"It will go hard-with him," declared the master. "He'll not
  get out of this without suffering the penalty."</p>

  <p>Harris was sullen and silent. Frank spoke to him before he was
  led away.</p>

  <p>"Harris," he said, "you have brought destruction on yourself.
  I can't say that I arm sorry for you, for, by your persistent
  attacks on me, you have destroyed any sympathy I might have felt.
  You have ruined your own life."</p>

  <p>"No!" snarled Sport. "You are the one! You ruined me! If I go
  to prison for this, I'll get free again sometime, and I'll not
  forget you, Frank Merriwell! All the years I am behind the bars
  will but add to the debt I owe you. When I come forth to freedom,
  I'll find you if you are alive, and I'll have your life!"</p>

  <p>Then he was marched away between two stout men, his irons
  clanking and rattling.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

  <h3>THE GAME IN THE NEXT ROOM.</h3>

  <p>When Merry appeared in his stateroom he was greeted with a
  storm of questions.</p>

  <p>"Well, what does this mean?"</p>

  <p>"Trying to dodge us?"</p>

  <p>"Running away?"</p>

  <p>"Muts the whatter with you&mdash;I mean what's the
  matter?"</p>

  <p>"Where have you been?"</p>

  <p>"Stand and give an account of yourself!"</p>

  <p>Then he told them a little story that astounded them beyond
  measure. He explained how he had taken a fancy to look the
  steamer over and had fallen in with the engineer. Then he related
  how he had visited the engine room and been thrown into the
  stoke-hole.</p>

  <p>But when he told the name of his assailant the climax was
  capped.</p>

  <p>"Harris?" gasped Rattleton, incredulously.</p>

  <p>"Harris?" palpitated Diamond, astounded.</p>

  <p>"Harris?" roared Browning, aroused from his lazy
  languidness.</p>

  <p>"On this steamer?" they shouted in unison.</p>

  <p>"On this steamer," nodded Frank, really enjoying the sensation
  he had created.</p>

  <p>"He&mdash;he attacked you?" gurgled Rattleton, seeming to
  forget his recent sickness.</p>

  <p>"He did."</p>

  <p>"And you escaped after being thrown into the stoke-hole?"
  fluttered Diamond.</p>

  <p>"I am here."</p>

  <p>"And you didn't kill the cur on sight?" roared Browning.</p>

  <p>"He is in the hold in irons."</p>

  <p>"Serves him right!" was the verdict of Frank's three
  friends.</p>

  <p>"Well, this is what I call a real sensation!" said the
  Virginian. "You certainly found something, Frank!"</p>

  <p>"Well, that fellow has reached the end of his rope at last,"
  said Harry, with intense satisfaction, once more stretching
  himself in his bunk.</p>

  <p>"That's pretty sure," nodded Jack. "Attempted murder on the
  high seas is a pretty serious thing."</p>

  <p>"He'll get pushed for it all right this time," grunted
  Browning, beginning to recover from his astonishment.</p>

  <p>Then they talked the affair over, and Frank gave them his
  theory of Sport's presence on the steamer, which seemed
  plausible.</p>

  <p>"This is something rather more interesting than the
  superstitious man or the Frenchman," said Diamond.</p>

  <p>"The superstitious man was interesting at first," observed
  Merry; "but I've a fancy that he might prove a bore."</p>

  <p>Then Bruce grunted:</p>
  <pre>
     "Say, does Fact and Reason err,
     And, if they both err, which the more?
     The man of the smallest calibre
     Is sure to be the greatest bore."
</pre>

  <p>While they were talking, the sound of voices came from the
  stateroom occupied by the Frenchman. Soon it became evident that
  quite a little party had gathered in that room.</p>

  <p>The boys paid no attention to the party till it came time to
  turn in for the night. Then they became aware that something was
  taking place in the adjoining room, and it was not long before
  they made out that it was a game of poker.</p>

  <p>As they became quiet, they could hear the murmur of voices,
  and, occasionally, some person would speak distinctly, "seeing,"
  "raising" or "calling."</p>

  <p>Diamond began to get nervous.</p>

  <p>"Say," he observed, "that makes me think of old times. Many a
  night I've spent at that."</p>

  <p>"What's the matter with you?" said Frank. "Do you want to go
  in there and take a hand?"</p>

  <p>"Well," Jack confessed, "I do feel an itching."</p>

  <p>"I feel like getting some sleep," grunted Bruce, "and they are
  keeping me awake."</p>

  <p>"Why are they playing in a stateroom, anyhow?" exclaimed
  Frank. "It's no place for a game of cards at night."</p>

  <p>"That's so," agreed Rattleton, dreamily. "But you are keeping
  me awake by your chatter a good deal more than they are. Shut up,
  the whole lot of you!"</p>

  <p>There was silence for a time, and then, with a savage
  exclamation, Diamond sprang out of his berth and thumped on the
  partition, crying:</p>

  <p>"Come, gentlemen, it's time to go to bed! You are keeping us
  awake."</p>

  <p>There was no response.</p>

  <p>Jack went back to bed, but the murmuring continued in the next
  stateroom, and the rattle of chips could be heard
  occasionally.</p>

  <p>"What are we going to do about it, Merriwell?" asked Jack,
  savagely.</p>

  <p>"We can complain."</p>

  <p>But making a complaint was repellent to a college youth, who
  was inclined to regard as a cheap fellow anybody who would do
  such a thing, and Diamond did not agree to that.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Frank, "I suppose I can go in there and clean
  them all out."</p>

  <p>"How?"</p>

  <p>"At their own game," laughed Merry, muffledly.</p>

  <p>"If anybody in this crowd tackles them that way I'll be the
  one," asserted the Virginian.</p>

  <p>"Then nobody here will tackle them that way," said Frank,
  remembering how he had once saved Diamond from sharpers in New
  Haven.</p>

  <p>Frank was a person who believed that knowledge of almost any
  sort was likely to prove of value to a man at some stage of his
  career, and he had made a practice of learning everything
  possible. He had studied up on the tricks of gamblers, so that he
  knew all about their methods of robbing their victims. Being a
  first-class amateur magician, his knowledge of card tricks had
  become of value to him in more than one instance. He felt that he
  would be able to hold his own against pretty clever card-sharps,
  but he did not care or propose to have any dealings with such
  men, unless forced to do so.</p>

  <p>The boys kept still for a while. Their light was extinguished,
  but, up near the ceiling, a shaft of light came through the
  partition from the other room.</p>

  <p>Diamond saw it. He jumped up and dragged a trunk into position
  by that partition. Mounted on the trunk, he applied his eye to
  the orifice and discovered that he could see into the Frenchman's
  room very nicely.</p>

  <p>"What can you see?" grunted Browning.</p>

  <p>"I can see everyone in there," answered Jack.</p>

  <p>"Name them."</p>

  <p>"The Frenchman, the Englishman, the superstitious man, and our
  fresh friend, Bloodgood."</p>

  <p>"Same old crowd," murmured Frank.</p>

  <p>"Yes, and a hot old game!" came from the youth on the trunk.
  "My! my! but they are whooping her up! They've got plenty to
  drink, and they are playing for big dust."</p>

  <p>"Tell them to saw up till to-morrow," mumbled Bruce.</p>

  <p>Jack did not do so, however. He remained on the trunk,
  watching the game, seeming greatly interested.</p>

  <p>A big game of poker interested him any time. It was through
  the influence of Frank that he had been led to renounce the game,
  but the thirst for its excitements and delights remained with
  him, for he had come from a family of card-players and
  sportsmen.</p>

  <p>"Come, come!" laughed Frank, after a while; "I can hear your
  teeth chattering, old man. Get off that trunk and turn in."</p>

  <p>"Wait!" fluttered Jack&mdash;"wait till I see this hand played
  out."</p>

  <p>In less than half a minute he cried:</p>

  <p>"It's a skin game! I knew it was!"</p>

  <p>"What's the lay?" asked Merry.</p>

  <p>"That infernal Frenchman is a card-sharp!"</p>

  <p>"I suspected as much."</p>

  <p>"His pal is the Englishman. They are standing in
  together."</p>

  <p>"Yes?"</p>

  <p>"Sure thing. They are bleeding Bloodgood and Slush. Bloodgood
  thinks he's pretty sharp, and I have not much sympathy for him;
  but I am sorry for poor little Slush. He should have paid
  attention to some of his signs and omens. He knew something
  disastrous would happen during this voyage, and I rather think it
  will happen to him."</p>

  <p>Then Diamond thumped the wall again, crying:</p>

  <p>"Stop that business in there! Mr. Slush, you are playing cards
  with crooks&mdash;you are being robbed! Get out of that game as
  soon as you can!"</p>

  <p>There was a sudden silence in the adjoining room, and then M.
  Rouen Montfort was heard to utter an exclamation in French,
  following which he cried:</p>

  <p>"I see you to-morrow, saire! I make you swallow ze lie!"</p>

  <p>"You may see me any time you like!" Diamond flung back.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>

  <h3>THE HORRORS OF THE HOLD.</h3>

  <p>To the surprise of the four youths, M. Montfort utterly
  ignored them on the following day, instead of seeking "trouble,"
  as had been anticipated.</p>

  <p>"Well," said Jack, in disgust, "he has less courage than I
  thought. He is just a common boasting Frenchman."</p>

  <p>"He is not a common Frenchman." declared Frank. "I believe he
  is a rascal of more than common calibre."</p>

  <p>"But he lacks nerve, and I have nothing but contempt for him,"
  said the Virginian. "I didn't know but he would challenge me to a
  duel."</p>

  <p>"What if he had?"</p>

  <p>"What if he had?" hissed the hot-blooded Southern youth. "I'd
  fought him at the drop of the hat!"</p>

  <p>"That's all right, but you know most Frenchmen fight well in a
  duel."</p>

  <p>"I don't know anything of the kind. They are expert fencers,
  but I notice it is mighty seldom one of them is killed in a duel.
  They sometimes draw a drop of blood, and then they consider that
  'honor is satisfied,' and that ends it."</p>

  <p>It was midway in the forenoon that Frank met Mr. Slush on
  deck. The little man was looking more doleful and dejected than
  ever, if possible.</p>

  <p>"The&mdash;ah&mdash;the moon showed rather yellow last night,"
  he said. "That is a&mdash;a sure sign of disaster."</p>

  <p>"Well," said Merry, with a smile, "I think the disaster will
  befall you, sir, if you do not steer clear of the crowd you were
  in last night."</p>

  <p>Mr. Slush looked surprised.</p>

  <p>"Might I&mdash;ah&mdash;inquire your meaning?" he
  faltered.</p>

  <p>"I mean that you are playing poker with card-sharps, and they
  mean to rob you," answered Frank, plainly.</p>

  <p>"I&mdash;I wonder how you&mdash;er&mdash;know so much," said
  the little man, with something like faint sarcasm, as Frank
  fancied.</p>

  <p>"It makes little difference how I know it, but I am telling
  you the truth. I am warning you for your good, sir."</p>

  <p>"Er&mdash;ahem! Thank you&mdash;very much."</p>

  <p>Mr. Slush walked away.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'm hanged if he doesn't take it coolly enough!"
  muttered Frank, perplexed.</p>

  <p>Frank felt an interest to know how Sport Harris was getting
  along. He walked forward and found the captain near the steps
  that led to the bridge.</p>

  <p>In reply to Merry's inquiry, the captain said:</p>

  <p>"Oh, don't worry about him. There are rats down there in the
  hold, but I guess he'll be able to fight them off. He'll have
  bread and water the rest of the voyage."</p>

  <p>After that Merry could not help thinking of Harris all alone
  in the darkness of the hold, with swarms of rats around him,
  eating dry bread, washed down with water.</p>

  <p>Frank felt that the youthful villain did not deserve any
  sympathy, but, despite himself, he could not help feeling a pang
  of pity for him.</p>

  <p>When he expressed himself thus to his friends, however, they
  scoffed at him.</p>

  <p>"Serves the dog right!" flashed Diamond. "He is getting just
  what he deserves, and I'm glad of it!"</p>

  <p>"He will get what he deserves when we reach the other side,"
  grunted Browning.</p>

  <p>"No," said Merry; "he is an American, and he'll have to be
  taken back to the United States for punishment."</p>

  <p>"Well, he'll get it all right."</p>

  <p>"Well, I don't care to think that he may be driven mad shut up
  in the dark hold with the rats."</p>

  <p>This feeling grew on Frank. At last he went to the captain and
  asked liberty to see Harris.</p>

  <p>The request was granted, and, accompanied by two men, Frank
  descended into the hold.</p>

  <p>Down there, amid barrels and casks, they came upon Harris.
  Frank heard the irons rattle, and then a gaunt-looking, wild-eyed
  creature rose up before them, shown by the yellow light of the
  lanterns.</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell had steady nerves, but, despite himself, he
  started.</p>

  <p>The appearance of the fellow had changed in a most remarkable
  manner. Harris looked as if he was overcome with terror.</p>

  <p>"There he is," said one of the men, holding up his lantern so
  the light fell more plainly on the wretched prisoner.</p>

  <p>"Have you come to take me out of here?" cried Harris, in a
  tone of voice that gave Frank a chill. "For God's sake, take me
  out of this place! I'll go mad if I stay here much longer! It is
  full of rats! I could not sleep last night&mdash;I dare not close
  my eyes for a minute! Please&mdash;please take me out of
  here!"</p>

  <p>Then he saw and recognized Frank.</p>

  <p>"You?" he screamed. "Have you come here to gloat over me,
  Frank Merriwell?"</p>

  <p>"No," said Frank; "I have come to see if I can do anything for
  you."</p>

  <p>"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Harris, in a manner that made Frank
  believe madness could not be far away. "You wouldn't do that! I
  know why you are here! You have triumphed over me! You wish to
  see me in all my misery! Well, look at me! Here I have been
  thrown into this hellish hole, amid rats and vermin, ironed like
  a nigger! Look till you are satisfied! It will fill your heart
  with satisfaction! Mock me! Sneer at me! Deride me!"</p>

  <p>"I have no desire to do anything of the sort," declared Frank.
  "I am sorry for you, Harris."</p>

  <p>"Sorry! Bah! You lie! Why do you tell me that?"</p>

  <p>"It is the truth. You brought this on yourself, and
  so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

  <p>"Don't tell me that again! You have told it enough! If I'd
  never seen you, I'd not be here now. You brought it on me, Frank
  Merriwell. If I die here in this cursed hole, you'll have
  something pleasant to think about! You can laugh over it!"</p>

  <p>"You shall not die here, Harris, if I can help it. I'll speak
  to the captain about you."</p>

  <p>The wretch stared at Merry, his eyes looking sunken and
  glittering. Then, all at once, he crouched down there, his chains
  clanking, covered his face with his hands and began to cry.</p>

  <p>No matter what Harris had done, Frank was deeply pitiful
  then.</p>

  <p>"I shall go directly to the captain," he promised, "and I'll
  ask him to have you taken out of this place. I will urge him to
  have it done."</p>

  <p>Harris said nothing.</p>

  <p>Frank had seen enough, and he turned away. As they were moving
  off, Harris began to scream and call to them, begging them not to
  leave him there in the darkness.</p>

  <p>Those cries cut through and through Frank Merriwell. He knew
  he was in no way responsible for the fate that had befallen the
  fellow, and yet he felt that he must do something for Harris.</p>

  <p>He kept his word, going directly to the captain.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

  <h3>THE FINISH OF A THRILLING GAME.</h3>

  <p>The captain listened to what Frank had to say, but his
  sternness did not seem to relax in the least, as Merry described
  the sufferings the prisoner was enduring. But Frank would not be
  satisfied till the captain had made a promise to visit Harris
  himself and see that the fellow was taken out and cared for if he
  needed it.</p>

  <p>Needless to say that the captain forgot to make the visit
  right away.</p>

  <p>Frank did not tell his friends where he had been and what he
  had seen. He did not feel like talking about it, and they noticed
  that he looked strangely grim and thoughtful.</p>

  <p>Tutor Maybe tried to talk to him about studies, but Merry was
  in no mood for that, as his instructor soon discovered.</p>

  <p>Despite the fact that the sea was running high, Rattleton
  seemed to have recovered in a great measure from his sickness, so
  he was able to get on deck with the others. At noon, he even went
  to the table and ate lightly, drinking ginger ale with his
  food.</p>

  <p>An hour after dinner Frank found a game of poker going on in
  the smoking-room. Mr. Slush was in the game. So were the
  Frenchman, the Englishman, and Bloodgood.</p>

  <p>No money was in sight, but it was plain enough from the manner
  in which the game was played that the chips each man held had
  been purchased for genuine money, and the game was one for
  "blood."</p>

  <p>M. Montfort looked up for a moment as Frank stopped to watch
  the game. Their eyes met. The Frenchman permitted a sneer to
  steal across his face, while Frank looked at him steadily till
  his eyes dropped.</p>

  <p>At a glance, Merry saw that Bloodgood was "shakey." The fellow
  had been growing worse and worse as the voyage progressed, and
  now he seemed on the verge of a break-down.</p>

  <p>A few minutes after entering the room Frank heard one of the
  spectators whisper to another that Bloodgood was "bulling the
  game," and had lost heavily.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood was drinking deeply. Mr. Slush seemed to be
  indulging rather freely. The Frenchman sipped a little wine now
  and then, and the Englishman drank at regular intervals.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman was perfectly cool. The Englishman was
  phlegmatic. Slush hesitated sometimes, but, to the surprise of
  the boys, seemed rather collected. Bloodgood was hot and
  excited.</p>

  <p>Frank took a position where he could look on. He watched every
  move. After a time he discerned that the Englishman and the
  Frenchman were playing to each other, although the trick was done
  so skillfully that it did not seem apparent.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood lost all his chips. The game was held up for a few
  moments. He stepped into the next room and returned with a fresh
  supply.</p>

  <p>"This is the bottom," he declared. "You people may have them
  as soon as you like. To blazes with them! Let's lift the
  limit."</p>

  <p>"Ah&mdash;er&mdash;let's throw it off&mdash;entirely,"
  suggested Mr. Slush.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood glared at the little man in astonishment.</p>

  <p>"What?" he cried. "You propose that? Why, you didn't want to
  play a bigger game than a quarter limit at the start!"</p>

  <p>"Perhaps you are&mdash;er&mdash;right," admitted Mr. Slush.
  "I&mdash;er&mdash;don't deny it. But I have grown more&mdash;more
  interested, you understand. I&mdash;I don't mind playing a good
  game&mdash;now."</p>

  <p>"Well, then, if the other gentlemen say so, by the gods, we'll
  make it no limit!" Bloodgood almost shouted.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman bowed suavely, a slight smile curling the ends
  of his pointed mustache upward.</p>

  <p>"I haf not ze least&mdash;what you call eet?&mdash;ze least
  objectshong," he purred.</p>

  <p>"I don't mind," said the Englishman.</p>

  <p>Now there was great interest. Somehow, Frank felt that a
  climax was coming. He watched everything with deep interest.</p>

  <p>Luck continued to run against Bloodgood. To Frank's surprise,
  it was plain Mr. Slush was winning. This seemed to surprise and
  puzzle both the Englishman and the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>It was hard work to draw the little man in when Hazleton or
  Montfort dealt. On his own deal or that of Bloodgood, he seemed
  ready for anything.</p>

  <p>"By Jove!" whispered Frank, in Diamond's ear. "That man is not
  such a fool as I thought! I haven't been able to understand him
  at all, and I don't understand him now."</p>

  <p>At length there came a big jack-pot. It was passed round
  several times. Then Hazleton opened it on three nines.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood sat next. He had two pairs, aces up, and he raised
  instantly.</p>

  <p>Montfort was the next man. He held a pair of deuces, but he
  saw all that had been bet, and doubled the amount!</p>

  <p>Mr. Slush hesitated a little. He seemed ready to lay down, but
  finally braced up and came in, calling.</p>

  <p>Hazleton did not accept the call. He raised again.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood looked at his hand and cursed under his breath. It
  was just good enough to make him feel that he ought to make
  another raise, but he began to think there were other good hands
  out, and it was not possible to tell where continued raising
  would land him, so he "made good."</p>

  <p>With nothing but a pair of deuces in his hand, Montfort
  "cracked her up" again for a good round sum.</p>

  <p>The hair on the head of Mr. Slush seemed to stand. He
  swallowed and looked pale. Then he "made good."</p>

  <p>Hazleton had his turn again, and he improved it. For the next
  few minutes, Montfort and Hazleton had a merry time raising, but
  neither Slush nor Bloodgood threw up.</p>

  <p>"This is where they are sinking the knife in the suckers!"
  muttered Jack Diamond.</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell said not a word. His eyes were watching every
  move.</p>

  <p>At last the betting stopped, and Slush picked up the pack to
  give out the cards.</p>

  <p>Hazleton called for two. He received them, and remained
  imperturbable.</p>

  <p>He had caught nothing with his three nines.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood had tumbled to the fact that he was "up against"
  threes, and he had discarded his pair of low cards, holding only
  the two aces. To these he drew a seven and two more aces!</p>

  <p>Bloodgood turned pale and then flushed. He held onto himself
  with all his strength. Here was his chance to get back his
  losings. Everything was in his favor. He was confident there were
  some good hands out, and it was very likely some of them might be
  improved on the draw, but he felt the pot was the same as
  his.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman drew two cards.</p>

  <p>Slush took one.</p>

  <p>Then hot work began. Within three minutes Hazleton, with his
  three nines, had been driven out. Bloodgood, Montfort and Slush
  remained, raising steadily.</p>

  <p>There was intense excitement in that room. The captain of the
  steamer had come in, and he was looking on. Some of the
  spectators were literally shaking with excitement.</p>

  <p>Bloodgood's chips were used up. He flung money on the
  table.</p>

  <p>All that he had went into the pot, and still he would not
  call. He offered his I.O.U.'s, but Mr. Slush declined to
  agree.</p>

  <p>"Money or its equivalent," said the little man, with such
  decisiveness that all were astonished.</p>

  <p>"I haven't any money," protested Bloodgood.</p>

  <p>"Then you are out," said Slush.</p>

  <p>"It's robbery!" cried Bloodgood.</p>

  <p>"Why, you can't kick; you haven't even called once."</p>

  <p>"Not even once, saire," purred the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"By blazes! I have the equivalent!" shouted Bloodgood.</p>

  <p>Into an inner pocket he plunged. He brought out a velvet jewel
  box. When this was opened, there was a cry of wonder, for a
  magnificent diamond necklace was revealed.</p>

  <p>"That is worth ten thousand dollars!" declared Bloodgood, "and
  I'll bet as long as it lasts!"</p>

  <p>Mr. Slush held out his hand.</p>

  <p>"Please let me examine it," he said.</p>

  <p>He took a good look at it.</p>

  <p>"Ees it all right, sair?" asked the Frenchman, eagerly.</p>

  <p>"It is," said Mr. Slush, "and I will take charge of it!"</p>

  <p>He thrust the case into his pocket, rose quickly, stepped past
  Montfort and clapped a hand on Bloodgood's shoulder.</p>

  <p>"I arrest you, Benton Hammersley, for the Clayton diamond
  robbery!" he said. "It is useless for you to resist, for you are
  on shipboard, and you cannot escape."</p>

  <p>Bloodgood uttered a fierce curse.</p>

  <p>"Who in the fiend's name are you?" he snarled, turning
  pale.</p>

  <p>And "Mr. Slush" answered:</p>

  <p>"Dan Badger, of the New York detective force! Permit me to
  present you with a pair of handsome bracelets, Mr.
  Hammersley."</p>

  <p>Click&mdash;the trapped diamond thief was ironed!</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

  <h3>FIRE IN THE HOLD.</h3>

  <p>Everyone except the detective himself seemed astounded. The
  clever officer, who had played his part so well, was as cool as
  ice.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman cried:</p>

  <p>"But zis pot&mdash;eet ees not settailed to whom eet belong
  yet!"</p>

  <p>The detective stepped back to his chair.</p>

  <p>"The easiest way to settle that is by a show-down," he said.
  "Under the circumstances, further bettering is out of the
  question."</p>

  <p>"And I rather think I am in the showdown," choked out the
  prisoner. "I'll need this money to defend myself when I come to
  trial."</p>

  <p>"You shall have it," assured Dan Badger&mdash;"if you win
  it."</p>

  <p>"Well, I think I'll win it," said the ironed man, spreading
  out his hand. "I have four aces, and you can't beat that."</p>

  <p>"Oh, my dear saire!" cried the Frenchman. "Zat ees pretty
  gude, but I belief zis ees battaire. How you like zat for a
  straight flush?"</p>

  <p>He lay his cards on the table, and he had the two, three,
  four, five and six of hearts.</p>

  <p>There was a shout of astonishment.</p>

  <p>"Ze pot ees mine!" exultantly cried the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"Stop!" rang out Frank Merriwell's clear voice. "That pot is
  not yours!"</p>

  <p>Everyone looked at Merry.</p>

  <p>"He is using a table 'hold-out!'" accused Frank, pointing
  straight at Montfort. "I saw him make the shift. The five cards
  that really belong in his hands will be found in the hold-out
  under the table!"</p>

  <p>There was dead silence. The Frenchman turned sallow.</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference," said the quiet voice of the
  detective, breaking the silence. "I have a higher straight flush
  of clubs here. Mine runs up to the eight spot, and so I win the
  pot."</p>

  <p>He showed his cards and raked in the pot.</p>

  <p>With a savage cry, M. Montfort flung his hand aside, leaped to
  his feet, sprang at Frank, and struck for Merry's face.</p>

  <p>The blow was parried, and he was knocked down instantly.</p>

  <p>A sailor, pale and shaking, came dashing into the room and
  whispered a word in the captain's ear.</p>

  <p>An oath broke from the captain's lips, and he whirled about
  and rushed from the room.</p>

  <p>Slowly Montfort picked himself up. There was a livid mark on
  his cheek. He glared at Frank with deadly hatred.</p>

  <p>"Cursed meddlaire!" he grated. "You shall pay for this."</p>

  <p>There was consternation outside. On the deck was heard the
  sound of running feet.</p>

  <p>"Something has happened!" said Diamond, hurrying to the door.
  "I wonder what it is."</p>

  <p>The "Eagle" was plunging along through a heavy sea. On the
  deck some men were running to and fro. Everyone seemed in the
  greatest consternation.</p>

  <p>Jack sprang out and stopped a man.</p>

  <p>"What is the matter?" he demanded.</p>

  <p>"The ship is on fire!" was the shaking answer. "There is a
  fire in the hold!"</p>

  <p>Diamond staggered. He whirled about and sprang into the
  smoking-room. In a moment he was at Frank's side.</p>

  <p>"Merry," he said, "what I feared has come! The steamer is on
  fire!"</p>

  <p>"Where?"</p>

  <p>"In the hold."</p>

  <p>Frank remembered the barrels and casks he had seen there.</p>

  <p>"Then we are liable to go scooting skyward in a hurry!" he
  said. "It can't take the fire long to reach the petroleum and
  powder!"</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

  <h3>SAVING AN ENEMY.</h3>

  <p>In truth, there was a fire in the "Eagle's" hold. The captain
  and the crew seemed perfectly panic-stricken. The thought of the
  explosion that might come any moment seemed to rob them of all
  reason.</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell and his friends rushed out of the
  smoking-room.</p>

  <p>The hold had been opened in an attempt to get water onto the
  flames. Smoke was rolling up from the opening.</p>

  <p>"Close down the hatch!" shouted somebody. "It is producing a
  draft, and that helps the fire along!"</p>

  <p>Then faint cries came from the hold&mdash;cries of a human
  being in danger and distress!</p>

  <p>"It's Harris!" exclaimed Diamond. "He is down there, and his
  time has come at last!"</p>

  <p>"A rope!" shouted Frank Merriwell, flinging off his coat.</p>

  <p>"What are you going to do?" demanded Bruce Browning.</p>

  <p>"By heavens! I am going down there and try to bring Harris
  out!"</p>

  <p>"You're a fool!" chattered Harry Rattleton. "Think of the oil
  and powder down there! The stuff is liable to explode any moment!
  You shall not go!"</p>

  <p>Frank saw a coil of rope at a distance. He rushed for it,
  brought it to the hold, let an end drop and dangle into the
  darkness from whence the smoke rolled up.</p>

  <p>"You are crazy!" roared Bruce Browning, attempting to get hold
  of Frank. "I refuse to let you go down there!"</p>

  <p>"Don't put your hands on me, Browning!" cried Frank. "If you
  do, I shall knock you down!"</p>

  <p>They saw that he meant just what he said. He would not be
  stopped then. Bruce Browning, giant that he was, felt that he
  would be no match for Frank then.</p>

  <p>The rope was made fast, and down into the smoke and darkness
  slid Frank, disappearing from view.</p>

  <p>Barely had he done so when some sailors came rushing forward
  and attempted to close the hatch.</p>

  <p>"Hold on!" thundered Browning. "You can't do that now!"</p>

  <p>"Get out of the way!" commanded one of them, who seemed to be
  an officer. "We must close this hatch to hold the fire in check
  long enough for the boats to be lowered."</p>

  <p>"A friend of mine has gone down there. You can't close it till
  he comes out!"</p>

  <p>"To blazes with your friend!" snarled the man. "What business
  had he to go down there? If he's gone, he will have to stay
  there. His life does not count against all the others."</p>

  <p>Then, under his directions the men started to close the
  hatch.</p>

  <p>Browning sailed into them. He was aroused to his full extent
  by the thought of what would happen if the hatch was closed and
  Frank was shut down there with the fire and smoke. He knocked
  them aside, he hurled them away as if they were children. They
  could not stand before him for an instant.</p>

  <p>There was a cry from below.</p>

  <p>"Pull away, up there!"</p>

  <p>It was Frank's voice.</p>

  <p>Willing hands seized the rope. There was a heavy weight at the
  end of it. They dragged the weight up, with the smoke rolling
  into their faces in a cloud that grew denser and denser.</p>

  <p>And up through the smoke came Sport Harris, irons and all,
  with the ends of the rope tied about his waist!</p>

  <p>Frank had found Harris, and here the fellow was.</p>

  <p>They untied the rope from Sport's waist in a hurry. Then they
  lowered it again.</p>

  <p>"Pull away!"</p>

  <p>Frank Merriwell was dragged up through the smoke.</p>

  <p>"Now," said Browning, "down goes the hatch!"</p>

  <p>And it was slammed into place in a hurry, holding the smoke
  back.</p>

  <h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

  <h3>THE SEA GIVES UP.</h3>

  <p>The pumps were going, in an attempt to flood the hold, but the
  men did not attempt to fight the fire in anything like a
  reasonable manner.</p>

  <p>The knowledge of the cargo down there in the hold turned them
  to cowards and unreasoning beings. They were expecting to be
  blown skyward at any moment.</p>

  <p>Of a sudden the engines stopped and the "Eagle" began to lose
  headway. Men were making preparations to lower the boats.</p>

  <p>"Well, I'll be hanged if they are not going to abandon the
  ship!" exclaimed Frank. "The case must be pretty bad. I wonder
  how the fire started,"</p>

  <p>"I set it!"</p>

  <p>At his feet was Harris, whom he had just rescued from the hell
  below, and the fellow had declared that he set the fire!</p>

  <p>"You?"</p>

  <p>"Yes," said the wretch. "I was crazy. I found a match in my
  pocket, and I thought I was willing to roast if I could destroy
  you, so I set the fire. Pretty soon I realized what I had done,
  but then I found it too late when I tried to beat it out. The old
  steamer will go into the air in a few minutes, and we'll all go
  with it, unless we can get off in the boats right away."</p>

  <p>"It would have served you right had I left you to your fate!"
  grated Frank, as he turned away.</p>

  <p>He ran down to his stateroom to gather up some of the few
  little valuables he hoped to save. He was not gone long, but when
  he returned, he found two boats had been launched and were
  pulling away, the persons in them being in great haste to get as
  far from the steamer as they could before the explosion.</p>

  <p>Three or four women were in the first boat.</p>

  <p>It was rather difficult to lower the boats in the heavy sea
  that was running, but the men were working swiftly, pushed by the
  terror of the coming disaster.</p>

  <p>A little smoke curled up from the battened-down hatches.</p>

  <p>As Frank reached the deck, he nearly ran against M. Rouen
  Montfort, who was carrying a pair of swords in scabbards, which
  seemed to be treasures he wished to save.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman stopped and glared at Merry.</p>

  <p>"Cursed Yankee!" he grated. "I would like to put one of zese
  gude blades t'rough your heart!"</p>

  <p>"Haven't a doubt of it," said Merriwell, coolly. "That's about
  the kind of a man I took you to be."</p>

  <p>Another boat got away, and the last boat was swung from the
  davits.</p>

  <p>A sailor counted the men who remained and spoke to the
  captain. The latter said:</p>

  <p>"At best, the boat will not hold them all. There is one too
  many, at least. Let the fellow in irons stay behind."</p>

  <p>Harris heard this, and fancied his doom was sealed. He began
  to beg to be taken along, but one of the men gave him a kick.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman turned on Frank.</p>

  <p>"Do you hear?" he cried. "One cannot go. Do you make eet ze
  poor deval in ze iron? or do you dare fight me to see wheech one
  of us eet ees? Eef you make eet ze poor devval, eet show you are
  ze cowarde. Ha! I theenk you do not dare to fight!"</p>

  <p>He spat toward Merry to express his contempt.</p>

  <p>"Let me fight him!" panted Diamond at Frank's elbow.</p>

  <p>"See that Harris is put into the boat!" ordered Merriwell. "I
  fancy I can take care of this Frenchman. If you do not get Harris
  into the boat I swear I will not enter it if I conquer
  Montfort!"</p>

  <p>Then he whirled on the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>"I accept your challenge!" he cried in clear tones.</p>

  <p>Montfort uttered an exclamation of satisfaction. He flung off
  his coat, saying:</p>

  <p>"Choose ze weapon, saire."</p>

  <p>Frank did not pause to look them over in making a selection.
  He caught up one of them and drew it from the scabbard.</p>

  <p>Montfort took the other.</p>

  <p>"Ready?" cried the American youth.</p>

  <p>"Ready!" answered the Frenchman.</p>

  <p>Clash!&mdash;the swords came together and there on the deck of
  the burning steamer the strange duel began.</p>

  <p>Frank fought with all the coolness and skill he could command.
  He fought as if he had been standing on solid ground instead of
  the deck of a ship that might be blown into a thousand fragments
  at any moment.</p>

  <p>The Frenchman had fancied that the Yankee would prove easy to
  conquer, but he soon discovered Frank possessed no little skill,
  and he saw that he must do his best.</p>

  <p>More than once Montfort thrust to run Frank through the body,
  and once his sword passed between the youth's left arm and his
  side.</p>

  <p>Merry saw that the Frenchman really meant to kill him if
  possible.</p>

  <p>Then men were getting into the boat. There were but few
  seconds left in which to finish the duel. Rattleton called to him
  from the, boat, shouting above the roar of the wind:</p>

  <p>"Finish him, Frank! Come on, now! Lively!"</p>

  <p>The tip of Montfort's sword slit Frank's sleeve and touched
  his arm.</p>

  <p>"Next time I get you!" hissed the vindictive Frenchman.</p>

  <p>But right then Frank saw his opportunity. He made a lunge and
  drove his sword into the Frenchman's side.</p>

  <p>Montfort uttered a cry, dropped his sword, flung up his hands,
  and sunk bleeding to the deck.</p>

  <p>Merry flung his blood-stained weapon aside and bent over the
  man, saying sincerely:</p>

  <p>"I hope your wound is not fatal, M. Montfort."</p>

  <p>"It makes no difference!" gasped the man. "You are ze victor,
  so I must stay here an' die jus' ze same."</p>

  <p>But Frank Merriwell was seized by a feeling of horror at the
  thought of leaving this man whom he had wounded. In a moment he
  realized he would be haunted all his life by the memory if he did
  so.</p>

  <p>Quickly he caught M. Montfort up in his arms. He sprang to the
  side of the steamer. The boat was holding in for him. His friends
  shouted to him. The captain ordered him to jump at once.</p>

  <p>"Catch this man!"</p>

  <p>He lifted M. Montfort, swung him over the rail, and dropped
  him fairly into the boat!</p>

  <p>"He has chosen," said the captain. "The boat will hold no
  more. Pull away!"</p>

  <p>It was useless for Frank's friends to beg and plead. Away went
  the boat, leaving the noble youth to his doom.</p>

  <p>Forty minutes later there was a terrible flare of fire and
  smoke, a thunderous explosion, and the ill-fated steamer had
  blown up.</p>

  <p>Harry Rattleton was crying like a baby.</p>

  <p>"Poor Frank!" he sobbed. "Noblest fellow in all the
  world&mdash;good-by! I'll never see you again!"</p>

  <p>Tears rolled down Bruce Browning's face, and Jack Diamond,
  grim and speechless, looked as if the light of the world had gone
  out forever.</p>

  <p>Some days later the passengers and crew from the lost "Eagle"
  were landed at Liverpool by the steamer "Seneca," which had
  picked them up at sea. The "Seneca" was a slow old craft, but she
  got there all right.</p>

  <p>A little grimy tender carried Bruce, Jack, Harry and the tutor
  from the "Seneca" to the floating dock. It was a sad and
  wretched-looking party.</p>

  <p>On the dock stood a young man who shouted to them and waved
  his hand.</p>

  <p>Jack Diamond started, gasped, clutched Browning and
  whispered:</p>

  <p>"Look&mdash;look there, Bruce! Tell me if I am going crazy, or
  do you see somebody who looks like&mdash;"</p>

  <p>Harry Rattleton clutched the big fellow by the other side,
  spluttering:</p>

  <p>"Am I doing gaffy&mdash;I mean going daffy? Look there! Who is
  that waving his hand to us?"</p>

  <p>"It's the ghost of Frank Merriwell, as true as there are such
  things as ghosts!" muttered Browning.</p>

  <p>But it was no ghost. It was Frank Merriwell in the flesh,
  alive and well! He greeted them as they came off the tender. He
  caught them in his arms, laughing, shouting, overjoyed. And they,
  realizing it really was him, hugged him and wept like a lot of
  big-hearted, manly young men.</p>

  <p>Frank explained in a few words. He told how, after they had
  left him, he had belted himself well with life-preservers and
  left the "Eagle" in time to get away before the explosion. Then
  he was picked up by an Atlantic liner, which brought him to
  Liverpool in advance of his friends.</p>

  <p>Thus he was there to receive them, and it seemed that the sea
  had given up its dead.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
